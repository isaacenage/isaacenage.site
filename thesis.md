ABSTRACT

Despite  being  one  of  the  fastest  growing  municipality  in  Rizal,  San  Mateo  still  experiences
extreme  landslides  events.  This  poses a serious problem to the safety of its current and future
residents  since  the  municipality  is  expected  to  carry  the  surplus  of  the  population  of  the
adjacent cities like Quezon City and Marikina City in the future. With this, the main objective of
this  study  is  to  conduct  two  different  landslide  risk  assessments  using  landslide  hazard  map
(LHM), landslide vulnerability map (LVM), and evaluation of the risk-perceptions of the selected
people in the municipality. The first landslide risk map (LRM) was produced using the LHM and
LVM.  LHM  was  produced  through  the relational analysis of the different environmental factors
and  the  landslide  inventory  processed  using logistic regression and ANN analysis. LVM and the
vulnerability of the people was measured using SVI. Results of the LHM showed that the highly
susceptible areas are located in the central and the eastern part of the municipality. Fortunately,
no  highly  susceptible  areas  are  found  in  the  areas  where  the  most  vulnerable  respondents
reside,  based  on  the  LVM  produced.  However,  these  same  vulnerable  respondents  were
considered  as  highly  at  risk  by  the  first  LRM  since they are vulnerable and are still exposed to
hazards.  Additionally,  all  the  respondents  are willing to accept the risks through boosting their
knowledge  on  landslides  such  as  attending  seminars  and  etc.  No  one  is  willing  to  leave  the
municipality  or  only pay for their safety. Also, all the respondents were classified as risk averse
and risk seekers based on their answers. Most of the locations and concentrations of the people
considered  as  highly  at  risk  by  the  first  LRM  is  similar  with  the  results  of  the  second  LRM
produced  from  the  risk-perception  of  the  people.  However,  rare  cases  still  exist  since  the
individual  perceptions  of  the  people  are  based  on  their  own  experiences  and  rationality.  In
conclusion,  both  the  two  landslide  risk  maps have their own strengths and weaknesses. While
one  approach  can  stand  on its own, the two approaches in landslide risk assessments are best
when combined.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

A. Background of the Study

Philippines  is  one  of  the  many  countries  in  Asia  gravely  exposed  to  a  vast  range  of

natural  hazards  and  disasters (The Guardian, 2010). From extreme typhoons and almost endless

rainfalls,  flashfloods,  volcanic  eruptions,  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  sudden  slope failures, down to

the most unexpected sinkholes and whirlpools, Philippines really seems to be a converging zone

of natural calamities. Even though many countries in Asia are more prone to natural hazard than

the  Philippines  (Assilzadeh,  2010),  the  social and economic capabilities of this country make it

more  vulnerable.  Japan,  for  example,  has  a  higher  likelihood  of  disaster  occurrence  than  the

Philippines,  but  it  does  not  make  it  more  vulnerable.  According  to  the  2010  World  Disasters

Report  of  the  International  Federation  of  Red  Cross  and  Crescent  Societies  (IFRC),  the

probability for a Filipino to be killed by a natural disaster is 17 times larger than the probability of

a  Japanese  being  killed  by  the  same  reason. This is because the difference of the quality of the

urban  and  environmental  planning  strategies  –  or  the  urban  risk  divide  –  between  the  two

countries is high, making the former more vulnerable.

This urban risk divide is severe in Asia, especially in the developing countries such as the

Philippines. As a third world country situated in a latitude where typhoons frequently pass, and in

a region dominated by volcanoes and fault lines, the number of hazards, risks and vulnerabilities

that  threaten  the  country  is  nearly  impossible  to  measure.  One  leading  natural  hazard  that  is

widespread in the country is the landslide.

Landslide, put simply, refers to the downward movement of rocks, soil, and debris on an

oblique  surface  or  slope  (USGS,  2004).  Landslides  are  usually  naturally-occurring  in  the

environment,  but the incessant disuse of human activities made some of these events to become

human-induced.  The  elements  that  usually  affect  the  landslide  occurrences  are  slope  angle,

rainfall, weathering, land cover, overloading, and geology.

The  blending  of  the  naturally  immense  amount  of  rainfall  brought  by  typhoons  and

monsoons, and the geological perils (earthquake and volcanic eruptions) that exist in the country

transforms  the  terrain  of  the  Philippines  into  a  landslide-susceptible  state.  In  her interview last

2010,  former  senior  science  research  specialist  of  Mines  and  Geosciences  Bureau  (MGB)

Angelica  Sajona  told  Integrated  Regional  Information  Networks  (IRIN)  News  that  “[with]  the

changing  weather  conditions  and  amount  of  rainfall  each season brings, we could categorically

state that the number of landslide occurrences is increasing," With 80% of the country’s total land

area  being prone to landslide, MGB has also reported that the country ranks fourth in the list of

the most vulnerable countries to landslide hazard and risk in Asia (2010).

Clearly,  the  intensifying  vulnerability  of  the  entire  country  is  associated  with  the

increasing  population  of  its  vulnerable  communities.  As  the  population  grows,  more  and  more

people  will  continue  to  move  away  from  the  city  center  and  settle  at  the  periphery – that is, a

place  exhibiting  rapid  urbanization  but  lower  economic  and  social  development  (Chiu  and

Eidsvig,  2016).  This  study  used  the  case  of  the  National  Capital  Region  and  Region  –  IVA

CALABARZON as the example. In the future, surge of population movements from the National

Capital  Region  to  the  adjacent  region  is  expected  to  occur.  Unfortunately,  for  this  set-up,  the

general  geomorphological  make-up  of  the  provinces  in  the  adjacent  region,  in  this  case  the

Region IV-A, is mountainous and rugged, decreasing the number of safe habitable areas while at

the same time increasing the number of vulnerable population to landslide.   According to a map

issued by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (2011), 59 out of the 141 and municipalities (PSA,

2015)   in the region are highly susceptible to landslides.   Moreover, among the five provinces in

the  region,  Rizal  has  the  largest  area  of  highly  susceptible  space for landslides (DENR, 2012).

This poses a serious problem to the province because it is currently one of the nearest provinces

in Metro Manila that has the highest probability to become the basin of population pours from the

country’s  capital  region.  As  the population of National Capital Region increases, the number of

population  who  will  settle  in  landslide-susceptible  areas  in  Rizal  will  also increase because, as

stated previously, the safe zones in the province are very limited.

This  projected  problem,  however,  has  already  come  in  to  fruition  because  numerous

landslide  incidents  in  the  region  have  already  been  recorded  in  the  past  few  years.  Several

municipalities  have  already  experienced  disastrous  landslide  occurrences,  one  of  which  is  San

Mateo. The latest occurrence was verified last August 2017, where a major highway in Barangay

Silangan  was  destroyed  by  a  slope  failure  (ABS-CBN News, 2017). Another landslide incident

happened last July 2009, where two houses were destroyed (GMA News, 2009). Fortunately, no

deaths  were  recorded  in  the landslide events that have occurred in San Mateo. However, deaths

were  confirmed  in  the  landslide  incidents  in  other  municipalities.  Clearly,  safety  measures and

preparations  must  be  immediately  done  to  further prevent these tragic events from occurring in

the municipality. As such, landslide risk planning and mitigation in San Mateo must be carefully

administered to keep the communities and the infrastructures away from deadly hazards.

B. Research Objectives

The main objective of this study is to assess the overall condition of the selected people

on  landslide  risks  using  two  completely  different  approaches:  one  is  founded  on  GIS-based

techniques  and quantitative methods; the other is based on the landslide risk – perception of the

exposed people in the municipality. Also, this study evaluates the difference in the performance of

the two landslide risk assessment approaches. Through performing an integrated approach in the

assessment  of  the  landslide  hazard  extent  in  the  municipality,  risk-perception  of  the  selected

people in the susceptible areas, and the vulnerability of the selected people in San Mateo, Rizal,

the desired final maps were produced. Consequently, specific objectives were further identified to

expound the aim:

1.  To  produce  a  landslide  susceptibility  map  determining  the  extent  of  the  landslide

hazards  in  the  municipality  using  logistic  regression  model  and  artificial  neural

network in IBM SPSS Statistics 20 and digital cartography in ArcGIS 10.2.2;

2. To assess the socioeconomic, demographic, and physical vulnerability of the people in

the susceptible areas using the Social Vulnerability Index, and produce a vulnerability

map  displaying  the  areas  of  vulnerability  to  landslide  hazards  based  on  the

assessments conducted;

3.  To  produce  a  landslide  risk  map  based  on  the  landslide  hazard  map  and  landslide

vulnerability map;

4.  To  perform  an  analysis  measuring  the  extent  of  knowledge  and  landslide

risk-perception  of  the  selected  people  in  the  susceptible  areas  using  Preparedness

Model  and  Willingness  Diagram,  and  produce  a  landslide  risk  map  based  on  the

analysis performed, and finally;

5. To visually compare the two landslide risk maps and construct a possible explanation

of their similarities and differences.

Statement of the Problem

This  study  aimed  to  answer  one  general  question:  what  is  the  current  condition  of  the

selected  people  of  San  Mateo  in  terms  of  landslide  risks?  The  specific  objectives  of  the  study

remain  unclear  unless  questions  were  formulated  to  serve  as  guides.   To  further  specify  and

elucidate  the  detailed  aims  of  this  study,  below  are  the  research  questions  that  address  the

methods of every objectives provided:

1. Based on the results of landslide susceptibility map, what areas of San Mateo, Rizal are

highly  susceptible,  moderately  susceptible,  lowly  susceptible,  and  not  susceptible to

landslides?

2.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  landslide  vulnerability  map,  where  are  most  of  the

vulnerable population in the municipality located?

3. Based on the landslide risk map produced through combining the landslide hazard map

and landslide vulnerability map, where are the respondents who are at high risk mostly

concentrated?

4.  Based  on  the  preparedness  model,  how  do  the  selected  locals perceive their level of

preparedness  for  landslide  events  and  what  factors  contribute  in  shaping  their

preparation?

5.  Based  on  the  willingness  diagram,  how  willing  are  the  respondents  to  address  the

issues of landslide risks?

6.  Based  on  the  landslide  –  risk  perception  of  the  exposed  people  in  the  municipality,

where are the people who think they are at risk mostly located?

7. How do the two landslide risk maps produced differ from one another?

C. Significance of the Study

Despite its relatively small area, San Mateo is one of the fastest growing municipalities in

the province of Rizal (DILG, n.d.). Aside from the fact that it is one of the nearest municipalities

of Rizal from the National Capital Region, San Mateo is famous for its tourism accomplishments

and migration records. The municipality has one of the most perfect settings of residential areas

in  its  upland  area  part  –  the  mountains,  trees,  and  high  altitudes  provide  a  remarkable  rural

experience while at the same time maintaining the urban benefits because of its proximity to the

big cities such as Quezon City and Marikina City.

In  the  future,  it  can  be  projected  that  huge  population  of  people  will  migrate  to  the

municipality for permanent residency. This event is not far from reality since it is directly beside

the  most  populous  city  in  the country (Quezon City), and spaces are always limited. Given this

fact,  San  Mateo  is  one  of  the  few  municipalities  that  might  receive  the  largest  surplus  of  the

population of the Quezon city in the future.

This  projected  phenomenon,  however,  poses  a  big problem since the residential area of

San  Mateo  is  relatively  small.  The  high  population  flow  might  force  some  to  live  in  the

high-altitude  lands,  where  landslide  hazards  are  extremely  prominent.  However,  this  outcome

could be avoided if the landslide risks of some of the people will be assessed now.

This  study  conducts  an  assessment  on  the  current  conditions  of  the  selected  people on

landslide  risk  using  two  different  approach.  The  results  of  this  study  can  help  in  forming  an

overview of the current situation of the selected people in the municipality, while at the same time

evaluates  the effectiveness and the performance of the two landslide risk approaches conducted.

Considering  this  fact,  the  municipality  of  San  Mateo  can  benefit  from the results of this study.

This  study  will  also  greatly  help  future  researchers who might want to conduct a landslide risk

assessment and give them ideas on how to conduct one.

D. Scope and Limitations

The  study  was  conducted  inside  the  administrative  boundaries  of  San  Mateo,  and  the

results  of  the  study  will  only  be  applicable  within  the  municipality.  Most  of  the  data  used  in

generating  the  landslide  hazard  map  were  from  credible  open  source  websites.  The  landslide

inventory  was  produced  by  the  researcher  using  remote  sensing,  and  no  field  validations  were

conducted  due  to  time  and  capacity  constraints.  The  landslide  hazard  map  made  using  several

statistical  analyses  is just a general representation of the actual areas with landslide hazards and

does not assure a hundred percent precision in defining the boundaries of the real-world hazards.

Also,  the  areas  delineated  as  landslide hazards only show the probability of slope failure of the

land.  It  does  not  include  the  buffer  zones  in  which  the  landslides  will  pour.  Most  of  the

vulnerability  measures  only  pertain  to  the  head  of  the  family  surveyed,  and  not  to  the  entire

household/business  establishment.  The  accuracy  of  the  physically-made risk map was based on

the  accuracy  of  the  final  landslide  hazard  map  and  the  final  landslide  vulnerability  map.  This

means  that  the  flaws  and  limitations  of  the  prerequisite  maps  will  also  be  inherited  by  the

landslide  risk  map.  Also,  the  method  on  gathering  the  perceptions  of the respondents were not

purely  qualitative,  as  it  was  only  conducted  using  a  questionnaire  with  open  ended  questions.

Lastly,  the  general  analysis  on  the overall results of the study only included the 82 respondents

who willingly participated, and the conclusions that were generated were only applied to them.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURES

This chapter provides all the related literatures that have utilized, if not produced, all the

methodologies and frameworks used in this study. The identified themes in this chapter include:

(1)  methods  and  techniques  used  for  landslide  hazard  mapping;  (2)  generating  landslide

inventory;  (3)  possible  indicators  of  slope  failures;  (4)  methods  for  assessing  landslide

vulnerability;  and  (5)  methods  for assessing landslide risk-perception. Furthermore, this chapter

also discusses the gaps in the study and the conceptual framework generated by the researcher.

A. Landslide Risk Assessment

Aside from floods and typhoons, landslides are one of the most common calamities in the

Philippines that usually damages the normal lives of the people and their properties (Dumlao and

Victor,  2015).  The  United  States  Geological  Survey  (2004)  officially  defined  landslide  as  an

outcome  of  a  “wide  variety  of  processes  that induces the downward and outward movement of

slope-forming  materials  including  rock,  soil,  artificial  fill,  or  a  combination  of  these  [different

materials].” Landslides, however, do not only refer to sliding as what is written in its name but to

several types of movement. USGS clarified that the downward movement of the mixed materials,

or  regolith,  during  a  landslide  occurs  in  many  ways  such  as  falling,  flowing,  spreading,  and

toppling.  The  said  phenomenon  is  also  classified  by  these different types of movement and the

kinds  of  material  involved.  It  is  important  to  note  that  a  landslide  event  that  occurs  near  a

community  is  considered  a  hazard  –  that  is,  a  risk  to  become  a  potential  disaster  (Setiawan,

Kingma,  &  Westen,  2014).  Hence,  different  geographic  applications  and  contemporary

geotechnical approaches have been conducted to address the issue, one of which is landslide risk

assessment.

Landslide risk assessment is an integrated approach in evaluating the current status of an

area in terms of landslide hazard, and the exposed vulnerable population. As defined by Flanagan

et  al.,  (2011),  risk  is  the  product  of  hazard  exposure  and  vulnerability  minus  the  resources.

According  to  Dwyer  et  al.,  (2004);  and  UCLA  Center  for  Public  Health  and  Disasters  (2006),

hazard pertains to the existing threat in an area capable of harm. Vulnerability, on the other hand,

is  the  degree  to  which  living  things  can  be  affected  by  a  hazard.  Resources  are  the  assets  or

possessions  owned  by  the  exposed  entity  that  will  decrease  the negative effects of the hazards.

Finally,  risk  refers  to  the  probability  of  someone  to  be  affected  by  the  hazard,  which,  when

realized,  might  turn  to  a  disaster.  Accordingly,  in  conducting  landslide  risk  assessments,  it  is

important  to  first  identify the areal hazard extent and the degree of vulnerability of the exposed

population in that hazard (Abella and Westen, 2007). It is also suggested to consider the resources

owned  by  the  exposed  population  to  further  strengthen  the  integrity  of  the  study.  This  chapter

presents  different  related  studies  that  utilized  various  methods  and techniques in evaluating the

landslide hazards, landslide vulnerability, and landslide risks in different contexts.

B. Methods and Techniques Used for Landslide Hazard Mapping

Landslide  hazard  mapping  is  essential  for  the  assessment  and  mitigation  strategies  in

areas  exposed  to  landslide  hazards.  In  their study, Pardeshi et al. (2013) stated that recognizing

the risks brought about by the landslide hazards can lessen the damages it can deal to the people

by almost 90%. This supports the idea that there really is a need for landslide hazard assessments

regardless of the difference in approaches used. In their study, Cova and Conger (2003) said that

mapping  hazards  can  be  divided  into  two  (2)  ways  based  on  the  method  it  was  conducted:

inductive  and  deductive.  Mapping  landslide  hazards  using  the  inductive approach uses the past

landslide events to determine the conditions and factors that caused their occurrences. The spaces

where the landslides occurred are analyzed, and areas with the same conditions are then identified

using  overlays.  The  deductive  approach,  on  the  other  hand,  recognizes  an  already  existing

framework/  model  produced  using  established  equations.  The  equations,  e.g.,  slope  instability

equations, are applied to the current susceptibility study to identify the areas of landslide hazards.

However, the boundary separating the two approaches should not be drawn too sharply because,

like  Rodriguez and Malpica (2010) said, most hazard analyses could become accurate if viewed

from both perspectives. For instance, actual landslide events can be used to help build a deductive

process model.

  Another  classification  was  suggested  by  Jime´nez  -  Pera´lvarez  et  al.  (2008).  In  their

study, they proposed two (2) main methods in which landslide susceptibility can be assessed: (1)

based  on  different  models  and  frameworks  “[founded]  on  physical  and  mechanic  laws  of  the

equilibrium of forces”, and (2) based on established statistical methods founded on the paradigm

of positivism. The first method is briefly explained in the study of Autade et al. (2013), wherein

they stated that landslide susceptibility visually displays the area where landslides are most likely

to  occur  based  on  a  given  set  of  independent  physical  factors  (climate,  soil  type,  seismic

activities,  etc.)  processed  using  a  model.  This  is  different  to  the  second  approach  of  landslide

susceptibility  assessment,  a  statistical  approach  solely  based on mathematical analysis, wherein

the  susceptibility  is measured as the probability of spatial occurrence of slope failures produced

from  a  set  of  statistically-assessed  parameters  in  relation  to  the  previous  and  current  landslide

inventory  (Guzzetti  et  al.  2005).  However,  like  any  other  things,  each  strategy  has  its  own

advantages  and  disadvantages.  Carrara  et  al.  (1995)  affirmed  that  “[statistical]  models  are

primarily limited” since the methods on which they are founded is solely determined by the idea

that  the  previous  and  existing  landslide  locations  can  predict  the  possible  areas  of  future

occurrences. The physically-based methods, on the other hand, are highly dependent on the detail

and accuracy of the climatologic and geologic datasets used (Posner & Georgakakos, 2015). With

this, Rodriguez and Malpica (2010) finally concluded that using the combined methods of the two

ways  provided  above  produces  a  clearer  analysis  and  more  understandable  explanation  in

assessing  and  evaluating  landslide  susceptibility  than  when  one  is independently utilized. They

also added that applying the power of Geographic Information System (GIS) with both methods

could  create  a  more  explicit  assessment  and  evaluation  of  the  landslide  susceptibility  analysis

performed.

The use of the computer-based approach in scientific studies on the environmental hazard

assessments  came  with the rise of the digital age, which gave further power to the versatility of

GIS  in  the  contemporary  context (Ayalew & Yamagishi, 2004). GIS made the possibility of the

perfect integration of the physically-based models and statistically-founded methods of landslide

susceptibility  assessment  into  one  seemingly  flawless  procedure.  Van  Westen  (1994  &  2000)

made  a  substantial  contribution  in  the  classification  of  the  different  GIS-based  methods  of

landslide  susceptibility  assessment.  Van  Westen  said  that  GIS-based  methodologies  can  be

differentiated  into  three  (3)  different  classifications  based  on  their  approach:  (1)  the

empirically-based  approach;

(2)

the

statistical  quantitative  approach;  and

the

(3)

physically-based/process-based approach. The first approach is a heuristic qualitative method that

is  specifically  made  for  small-scale  regional  surveys.  In  this  method,  the  researchers  and  their

participants are the ones who decide how to map the landslide-susceptible areas using their own

classifications and standards. The procedure is purely qualitative, and the classifications of what

is susceptible and what is not are done solely through observations and experiences. The second

approach, based on the established concepts on the previous discussion, depends on an inventory

of the previous and existing landslide events. Statistical methods are always used to comprehend

the relationship between the actual landslide events and several parameters (Ermini et al. 2005).

This  kind  of  approach  promotes  lesser  subjectivities  compared  to  the  heuristic  and  qualitative

ones.  In  this  method,  predictions  are  produced  through  correlating  the  statistically-processed

factors to the actual landslide events and applying the results in landslide-free areas that have the

same conditions.   Statistical analyses are classified into two (2) categories, namely bivariate and

multifactorial  statistics.  Bivariate  statistics  is  quantitative  method  leaning  to  the  empirical

approach,  where  the  causal  parameters  are  crossed  with  the  actual  landslide  inventory, and the

weights  and  influence  of  each  factors  are  determined  through  both  experience  and  simple

statistics. Different statistical models have already been established from this approach: Westen’s

(1993, 1994) Landslide-Index Method; the Weights of Evidence by Poli and Sterlacchini (2007);

and  the  Matrix  method  conducted  by Clericj et al. (2002). Multifactorial statistical analyses, on

the other hand, are more data-driven rather than empirical. The statistically-processed parameters

are  analyzed  through  complex  multiple-regression  techniques,  and  the  results  are  validated  by

discriminant  analyses  –  that  is,  checking  the  significance  of each chosen factors based on their

degree  of  independence.  Most  of  the  related  studies  that  use  this  kind  of  method  is  Artificial

Neural  Network  (ANN)  model  and  Logistic  Regression  (LR)  model  mostly  used  by  Carrara

(1992)  and  Ayalew  et  al.  (2005).  The  last  approach  is  the  physically-based  or  process-based

approach for detailed and technical studies. The difference of this method to that of the first two

is vague and difficult to emphasize. Basically, physically-based GIS approaches require the more

technical  side  of geomorphology, geology, and geotechnical engineering. These kinds of studies

usually consist of many field visits and hands-on approaches than when one does the analysis in

front of the computer. Slope-stability is determined in situ by the experts using complicated and

state-of-the-art  tools and equipment. Most studies which used this method include of Pack et al.

(1998).

This  study  uses  the  second  classification  of  GIS-based  hazard  mapping,  specifically

Logistic  Regression  and  Artificial  Neural  Network.  Logistic  Regression  is  used  when  the

dependent variable being predicted is categorical – that is, classified into specifics. It conducts a

multivariate  regression  in  analyzing  the  relation between several independent variables and one

categorical dependent variable. Ayalew and Yamagishi (2005) particularly claimed in their study

that  GIS-based  Logistic  Regression  is  the  one  of the most effective model in creating landslide

susceptibility  maps,  along  with  Artificial  Neural  Network  Model  and  many  others.  Landslide

susceptibility  maps  that  are  based  on  these  two  statistical  models  primarily  focus  on  the

prediction  of  future  occurrences  of  landslides  based  on  the  previous  landslides.  The  landslide

inventory  is  coupled  with  several  environmental  factors  processed  statistically  to  ultimately

generate a dependable prediction of future landslide occurrences. These two types of data are the

two most essential information in conducting landslide susceptibility mapping (Lee et. al., 2016).

C. Generating Landslide Inventory

Acquisition  of  the  list  of  all  landslide  events  that  have  occurred  in  a  region  can  be

obtained from the respective departments and agencies of the area. However, various alternatives

have already been done by several studies on the generation of landslide inventory – one of which

is through remote sensing.

In  a  study  conducted  by  Nichol  and  Wong  (2005),  a  landslide inventory was produced

using  land  cover  change  detection  and  image  fusion  in  remote  sensing.  The  satellite  images

obtained  were  classified  into  different  land  covers.  The  specific  land  covers  examined  were

vegetation  and  bare  soil.  Using  two  different  satellite  images  scanned  by IKONOS in different

times, the change of vegetation to soil was monitored and analyzed. These changes represent the

soil  erosions  that  have  occurred  in  the  region  of  study,  possibly  identifying  areas  of  landslide

occurrences.  On  a  similar  study  done by Yang and Chan (2009), a landslide inventory was also

produced  using  remote  sensing.  However,  unlike  how  Nichol  and  Wong conducted their study,

Yang and Chan used a different method of performing landcover change detection. Their images

did not undergo image classification, instead they directly performed the change detection method

on the panchromatic images. Landslides were identified using the differences in brightness of the

features in the image.

D. Possible Indicators of Slope Failures

According to Abramson (2002), it is imperative to understand the purpose of predisposed

parameters  in  influencing  the  classification  of  slope  failures.  This  skill  is  important  for

ascertaining  the  spatial likelihood of slope failures and improves the accuracy and credibility of

the  results.  Besides,  accuracy  of  the  information  that  will  be  produced  in  the  landslide

susceptibility  assessment  is  important  for  planners,  architects,  and  engineers  as  it  will  surely

increase  the  assurance  of  safety  factor  in  their  plans.  Mitigating  the  susceptibility  requires  the

researcher,  planner,  or  administrator  of  prior  knowledge  to  the  speciﬁc  inclining  factors  that

influence slope instability.

There  are  numerous  variables involved with slope failures Their occurrence can happen

naturally,  be  triggered by human activities, or both (USGS, 2004). The fundamental factors that

affect  landslide  incidence already widely-accepted and used by all researchers who do landslide

susceptibility  assessment  include  the  slope  angle,  the  slope  aspect/direction,  plan  curvature,

bedrock  and  soil  conditions,  presence  of  previous  landslide  deposits,  land  cover,  proximity  to

water, proximity to roads, and elevation (Jiménez-Perálvarez et al., 2009; Dumlao & Victor, 2015;

Lee et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Westen, 2000; Poli, 2007; Posner, 2015).

Slope  angle  has  always  been  included  in  the  list  of  the  most  significant  factors  in

influencing slope instabilities (Jiménez-Perálvarez et al., 2009; Abramson, 2002; Lee et al., 2016;

Abella  &  Westen,  2007;  Posner  &  Georgakakos,  2015).  According  to  Abramson  (2002), slope

failures  are  the  most  usual  major  geomorphological  processes  that  occur  on  areas  with  greater

than  45  percent  slope  angle.  When  the  angle  of  the  slopes  exceeds  the  angle  of repose for the

unconsolidated  soil,  there  is  a  very  high  possibility  that  a  landslide  will  occur  (Duncan  et  al,

2014). However, it is important to note that while landslide incidences are largely correlated with

the  steepness  of  the  slope  in  geomorphologic environments, it must be taken into consideration

that high slope angles do not always result to earth and debris flows. High slope angles on earth’s

surface  are  often  caused  by the presence of stony layers arranged in sequences, which indicates

the  structure  of  the  regolith  (Grelle  et  al.  20llb).  Most  of  the  time,  the  steepness  of  the  slope

affects  the  occurrence  of  soil  slips  –  landslides  that  involve  only  the  materials  above  the

compacted bedrock surface. According to Law (1983), the frequency of soil slips is found to have

a direct relationship with the slope angle but has inverse relationship with soil depth. In her study,

the  number  of  soil  slips  increases  as  the  slope  angle  increases  but  decreases  as  the  soil  depth

increases. This suggests that while slope angle really has a significant impact in the occurrence of

landslides,  it  must  be  combined  with  many  other  factors  –  in  this  case,  the  soil  composition.

Another study conducted by Donnarumma et al (2013) validates the credibility of slope angle as

an indicator of slope failures. In their study, a statistical method known as the Gaussian function

was  used  to  assess  the  significance  of  the  locational  distribution  of  the mean slope angles of a

landslide population within a specified area. The results indicated that accurate and precise slope

analyses  considerably  improved  landslide  susceptibility  analyses  in areas characterized by their

complex  terrains.  This  evaluates  its  significant  contribution  in  hazard  mapping as an important

landslide affecting factor.

The  gradient  of  a  slope  angle  comes  with  the  height  of  elevation.  Clearly,  most

geomorphological  landforms  that  have  steep  slopes  are  found  in  areas  of  high  elevation

(Donnarumma  et  al.,  2013).  Thus,  the  second  parameter  that  is  believed  to  influence  the

occurrences of landslides is the elevation. In a thorough study conducted by Tsutsui et al. (2007),

elevation  has  a  considerable  significance  in  affecting  the  substantial  amount  of  soil

characteristics, one of which is the soil stability. Higher elevation could mean lower temperature

and atmospheric pressure (and vice versa), affecting the chemical composition of the soil such as

its potential of Hydrogen (pH). This affects the ability of the soil to hold nutrients, and ultimately,

to  grow  plants.  The  existence  of  vegetation  is discernibly one of the most significant factors to

determine  the soil stability. Addtionally, in their study (Tsutsui et al., 2007), results showed that

high  elevations  are  are  correlated with landslide manifestations. However, Grelle et al., (2011b)

claimed  that elevation does not directly determine the occurrence of a landslide, because it only

affects several factors that have a more direct relationship to the said hazard event. Furthermore,

the points given above proves that elevation has to coexist with other factors – in Tsutsui et al.’s

case,  soil  –  to  be  able  to  directly  affect  the  landslide  occurrences.  This  situation  is  almost  the

same with the third parameter, the slope aspect. The significance of the slope face orientation, or

slope aspect, in the occurrence of landslide events is still largely debated up until today. However,

even  with  this  ambiguity,  there  are  many  who  still  consider  slope  aspect  as  one  of  the  most

important  influential  factors  for  landslide  occurrences  (Galli  et  al.,  2008;  and  Lee,  2005).

Conversely,  while  it  is  possible  to  include  the  slope  aspect  as a potential indicator of landslide

hazards, its effects are limited to certain types of landslides only (Luzi and Pergalani, 1999). On

the  other  hand,  many  authors  have  claimed  that  slope  aspect  cannot  predict the occurrences of

landslides  (Ohlmacher  and  Davis,  2003).  The  effects  of  slope  aspect  on  landslide  occurrences

become  only  noticeable when analyzing the more recent landslide susceptibility studies that use

multivariate  statistical  methods  (Blahut  et  al.,  2010).  To  finally  assess  the  relationship  of  the

tackled  factor  in  susceptibility  mapping,  Capitani  et  al.  (2013)  conducted  an  in-depth  study

measuring  the  degree  of  correlation  of  the  slope  aspect  on  the  distribution  of  landslides  in

Tuscany,  Italy.  Although  the  study  does  not  completely  aim  to  prove  that  slope  aspect  affects

landslide  susceptibility,  they  wanted  to  propose  various  situations  that  could  contribute  in

understanding the true role of slope face direction in the pattern of occurrence of slope failures. In

their  methodology.  two  statistical  methods  were  integrated,  the  bivariate  and  multivariate

statistical  analysis  to  assess  the  correlation  between  slope  aspect  and  landslide  distribution.

Furthermore, statistically – processed geo-environmental parameters believed to have weights in

indicating  landslide  phenomena  were  chosen  –  lithology,  slope  angle,  distance  to  streams,  and

proximity to tectonic lineaments. Results of the study showed that slope aspect directly affects the

soil condition of the basin in the area. Most of the slopes facing south and southwest experienced

the  highest  aridity  among  the  other  areas.  Extreme  sunny  conditions  in  the  area  lead  to  wide

expansions  of contraction cycles in the regolith of the basins, causing the creation of superficial

cracks.  This  set-up  is  further  worsened  during  rainy  conditions,  when  the  water  percolates

through the cracks, generating a circumstance of heavier slope load but more unconsolidated soil.

The  study  concluded  that  slope  aspect/  slope  face  direction  indirectly  contributes  to  the

occurrences  of  landslides  through  merging  with  the  other  factors  that  results  to  changing  the

condition of the soil. Finally, Capitani et al (2013) stated that while slope aspect only contributes

indirectly to manifestations of slope failures, it still contributes.

Another predisposing factor that might affect the occurrence of slope failures is the plan

curvature  (Dumlao  &  Victor,  2015;  Poli  &  Sterlacchini,  2007).   In  Mathematics,  curvature  is

defined as “[the] change in slope angle along a very small arc of the curve. (Thomas, 1968).” In a

study conducted by Ohlmacher (2007), plan curvature is defined as “[the] curvature of the hillside

in a horizontal plane or the curvature of the contours on a topographic map.” A straight line, or a

straight  slope  has  a zero curvature, and as the hill becomes more curved, the value of curvature

increases.  There  are  three  curvature  measurements  used  for  the  correlation  of  hillslope  and

landslide analysis: profile, plan, and tangential curvature (Ayalew and Yamagishi, 2004). Profile

curvature refers to the curvature in the slope aspect along the intersection of an imaginary vertical

plane  perpendicular  with  the  ground  surface.  Plan  curvature,  on  the  other  hand,  indicates  the

curvature  of  the  topographic  contours,  or  in  the  more  technical  term,  the  curvature  of  a  line

formed  by  the  intersection  of  an  imaginary  horizontal  plane  parallel  with  the  ground  surface.

Finally, tangential curvature denotes the curvature in a vertical plane that is tangent at the point of

interest. In the study of Ohlmacher (2007), hillslopes are classified into three (3) regions: concave

outward plan curvature, usually called hollows; convex outward plan curvature, commonly called

noses;  and  straight  contours,  also  known  as  planar  regions.  Past  statistical  analyses  of

plan-curvature  and  landslide  inventories  indicate that hillslopes with planar plan curvature have

the highest probability for landslides in regions dominated by earth flows and earth slides in clay

soils  (Devkota  et  al., 2013; Irigaray et al., 2007; Abramson, 2002). Olmacher (2007) also noted

that  the  probability  of  landslide  occurrence  decreases  on  concave and convex curvatures of the

slope.  Although  the  probability  of  landslide  occurrence  decreases  in  these  two  curvatures, it is

still important to note that concave, or hollows, have slightly higher susceptibility for landslides

than convex.. In concave curvatures, the regolith or soil materials converge into the narrow region

located  at  the  base  of  the  slope.  The  cohesive  property  of  fine-grained  soil,  when  combined,

strengthens  the  soil  consolidation,  and  increases  the  slope  stability  of  the  hollow  hillside.  In

conclusion,  he  stated  that  statistical analyses conducted for landslide susceptibility studies must

always consider the complex relationship between landslide types, plan curvatures, and landslide

susceptibility.

The  next  geo-environmental  factor  considered  to  affect  slope  stabilities  is  the  soil.

According  to  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  Of  The  United  Nations  (1990),  soil  is  the

unconsolidated  material  on the surface of the Earth formed because of its direct exposure to the

different  effects  of  environmental  processes  and  social  activities.  It  is  a  natural  resource

composed  of  a  variety  of  materials  such  as  weathered  rocks,  humus,  organic  substances,  and

many more. It is classified into several types based on their distinct characteristics. Identification

of  the  soil  type  is  paramount  to  help  in  creating  more  accurate  landslide susceptibility studies.

FAO (1990) categorized soil into sand, clay, chalk, silt, and loam based on the dominating size of

the  particles  in  the  bunch.  Among  these  types,  three  are  most  commonly  used  in  assessing

landslide susceptibilities: sand, silt, and clay. Clay, having a size of less than 0.002 mm, refers to

the finest particles in the soil, yet also the most consolidated. Because of their very small size and

very large surface area, they can absorb and hold greater amounts of water compared to sand and

silt  soils.  Clay  size  particles  build  most  of  the  chemical  properties  of  soil. They react with the

organic matter to stabilize the humus in the soil. Most of the infertile soils on Earth do not have

clay particles, proving the significance of clay in agriculture and vegetation. However, abundance

of clay in an agricultural area would also be stressful for farmers because clay soils are difficult to

till.  Clay  particles  have  the highest tendency to clump together, making it difficult for landslide

events  to  occur.  However,  it  is  also  important  to  realize  that  this  strong  clustering  of  the  clay

particles could prove deadly should it fall into a landslide tendency since it is the heaviest, and the

densest among the three.

Silt  particle,  on  the  other  hand,  are  intermediate  in  size.  The  silt  particles,  with  a  size

range of 0.002 to 0.05 mm, have lesser tendencies to clump together than the clay but have higher

tendencies compared to sand. They are also below clay in absorbing and holding much water but

perform  superiorly  than  sand.  The  particles  are  generally  spherical  in  shape,  giving  the  soil

slippery  and  smooth  feeling  when  rubbed between the hands. Because of its shape, silt soil can

also  hold  a  large  amount  of  water  but releases it faster than clay. The last soil type is the sand,

with  a  size  range  of  0.05  mm  to 1.0 mm. They are generally composed of very unconsolidated

small  rock  fragments  that  have  little  capacity  to  hold  water  longer,  therefore  very  little  to  no

ability  of supplying nutrients to vegetation. Compared to silt and clay, sand particles feel coarse

when  rubbed  between  the  hands.  Sand  soil  have  little  ability to clump together, making it very

susceptible  to  slope  failures  when  exposed  to  other  disrupting  factors  such  as  water  and

earthquakes.  When  irrigation,  rain,  groundwater,  or  surface  water  flows  through  the  ground,  it

penetrates the soil surface and percolates through the spaces in between, and further weakens the

sticking of each particles to each other.

Clearly, soil has a direct contribution in landslide phenomena since it is the characteristics

of the soil that dictate the degree and type of a landslide that will occur.  One study conducted by

Kitutu et al. (2009) evaluates the influence of soil properties on landslide occurrences in Bududa

district, Eastern Uganda. In his study, he noticed that soil properties directly affect slope stability.

These soil characteristics influence the rate of water movement in the soil and its ability to absorb

and hold water. Additionally, Zung (2008) stated that certain soil characteristics may be useful for

assessing the landslide frequency. Normally, it is safe to assume that among the different types of

soil, sand is the most susceptible to landslide because of its very low compactness. The results of

the  study  done  by  Kitutu  et  al. (1985), however, proved this hypothesis to be incorrect since in

their discussion, clay soil emerged to be the most susceptible soil type to landslide. They reasoned

this  with  the  fact  that  because  clay  particles  are  very  compact,  the  plants  on  the  surface

experience difficulties in absorbing sufficient minerals and water. This makes the clay soil to only

be  able  to  sustain  very  few  plants,  making  its  surface  almost  bare/no  vegetation.   In  another

similar  study,  it  was  claimed  that  the  “[swelling] properties of clay and the rate at which water

infiltrates  into  the  clay  at  depth”  have  been  identified  as  a  significant  factor  in  influencing

landslides  occurrences  (Inganga  and  Ucakuwun,  2001).  In  conclusion,  it  is  safe  to assume that

soil characteristics and properties is indeed one of the most significant factors that affect landslide

occurrences.

Other  natural  phenomena,  such  as  earthquakes  and  rainfalls,  also  affect  the  soil

compactness  and  slope  stability,  generating  natural  landslides  (Duncan  et  al., 2014). There are,

however,  cases  by  which  landslides  are  solely  caused  by  human  activities.  Two  of  the  most

infamous  activities always associated with the occurrence of landslides are the clear-cutting and

road  constructions.   Clear-cut  loggings  increase  the  risk  of  landslide  occurrences,  because  the

vegetation that holds the soil are being destroyed. At the same time, road constructions also raise

the probability of landslides because of the decrease in soil strength and increase in erosion. The

soil strength decreases because roadcuts are steeper than natural slopes, and soil erosion increases

because  the  establishment  of  roads  comes  along  with  the  human  intervention  with  the  natural

flow  of  the  ground  water  (Inganga  et  al.,  2001).  However,  Swanson  and  Dyrness  (1975)

concluded  in  their  study  that  road  cuttings  do  not  always  cause  or  induce  landslide  events.

Currently, the road constructions put into practice by many developed countries are strict and the

process  for  applications  is  rigorous.  They  further  claimed  that  most  cases  that  experience

landslide occurrences near road cuts are more frequent in the developing countries. This suggests

that road cutting, as an indicator of landslide phenomena in San Mateo, Rizal, is applicable in this

study because the Philippines is a developing country.

The  last  parameter  to  be  considered  as  an  indicator  of  landslide  occurrences  in  San

Mateo,  Rizal  is  the  proximity  to  stream  networks.  Proximity  to  streams  does  not  necessarily

indicate  the  existence  of  landslide  events,  rather,  like  the  distance  to  roads,  it  signifies  the

weakness  of  soil  compactness  in  the area. Naturally, as what is stated by Duncan et al., (2014),

natural landslides are either rainfall – induced, or earthquake – induced.   This information gives

us  the  weight  of  the  significance  of  water  to  landslide  incidents.  Water,  be  it  surface  water  or

groundwater,  influences  the  soil  stability  in  many  ways  (Liu  & Li, 2015). The surface run-offs

can  cause  severe  soil  erosion  and  the  viscosity  of  the  landslide.  The  groundwater  can  cause

erosion from seepage, increase of groundwater table, increase of water pressure in the pores of the

soil, and many more.

There are indeed many factors that influence the creation of a landslide. However, like all

the factors mentioned above, a single factor cannot affect the probabilities of slope failures alone.

No single factor of landslides affect the occurrence of it, because a number of conditions have to

work with one another in order to result to a potential slope failure (Blahut et al., 2010).

E. Method for Assessing Landslide Vulnerability

Disaster  managements  for vulnerability assessments in the past have always been based

on  the  physical  approaches  and  technical  methods.  The  realization  of  this  point  made  several

researchers appreciate the importance of socioeconomic factors in evaluating the resilience of the

communities  in  disaster  management  contexts  and  led  them  to  create  the  concept  of  social

vulnerability  (Chiu  and  Eidsvig, 2016). Social vulnerability pertains to the level of resilience of

the  communities  that  are  exposed  to  hazards.  It  incorporates  the  measures  of  socioeconomic,

demographic,  and  physical  factors  that  affect  their  capacity  to  withstand  all  kinds  of  hazards.

Subsequently, an efficient approach in dealing with social vulnerabilities might help decrease the

damages  of  a  disaster  to  communities.  To  simplify  the  approach  in  evaluating  social

vulnerabilities,  a  framework  called Social Vulnerability Index was developed by Flanagan et al.

(2011).  Fundamentally,  Social  Vulnerability  Index  (SVI)  is  a  mitigation  tool   developed  to

evaluate  the  relative  social  vulnerability  of  the  exposed  population  across  an  area.  It  is

particularly  used  during  disasters  —  either  natural  or  human-caused  —  to  help  the  rescuers

identify populations that may need more help.

In  evaluating  the  social  vulnerability,  three  specific  measures  were  identified:

socioeconomic  vulnerability,  demographic  vulnerability,  and physical vulnerability (Flanagan et

al., 2011). Each measure contains specific standards that determine the presence of vulnerability.

One  is  considered  vulnerable  if  he/she  exhibits  vulnerability  from  the  two  out  of  the  three

vulnerability measures. However, Flanagan et al., (2011) further clarified that Social Vulnerability

Index  is  just  the  first  phase  in  identifying  populations that are more vulnerable than the others.

The  importance  of  the different measures varies depending on the situation. Acquiring the most

accurate measures of vulnerability still involves the primary information from the locals that are

more reliable than what these standards can ever evaluate.

F. Methods for Assessing Landslide Risk – Perception

In  addressing  disaster  mitigation  plans and strategies, it is always important to consider

the perceptions of the exposed people to different hazards and risks (Tulloch and Lupton, 2003).

The active involvement of the concerned population greatly contributes in their preparation from

the  risks  and  potential  disasters  in  their  environment  (Wang  et  al.,  2013).  Furthermore,

comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  knowledge,  attitude,  awareness,  and  perceptions  of  landslide

risks  among  the  people that are most exposed to hazards is the most crucial part in disaster and

risk  reduction  management  plans  (Calvello  et  al.,  2016).  There  are many known approaches in

evaluating the risk-perceptions of the people in the concept of landslide. The group of Chaturvedi

et al. (2015) and the pair of Alcántara-Ayala and Moreno (2016) suggested two ways in assessing

the overall risk-perception of a person on hazards such as landslide. First is to know the extent of

their knowledge about landslides, their current situation on landslide threats, and their awareness

of its effects to them. The second method is to assess their possible decisions and strategies when

faced with the real ones.

In  dealing  with  the  first  suggested  approach,  Enders  (2001)  recommended  the

preparedness  model  constructed  by  Rhodes  &  Reinholtd  (1999).  This  model  works  on  a

foundation  that  believes  that people only respond or act to a hazard based on their “knowledge,

expectations,  [and]  perceptions  [of  it],  along  with  a  range  of  other  influences  (Rhodes  &

Reinholtd,  1999).”  Consequently,  the  two  authors  presented  seven  (7)  indicators  that affect the

risk  –  perception  of  a  person  on  a hazard: awareness, risk recognition, understanding, capacity,

threat  context,  response  orientation, and level of preparedness. These parameters help shape the

overall  involvement of the people in mitigations and safety plans (Enders, 2001). Moreover, the

model  also  suggests  a  flow  of  events  that  represent  the  different  stages  one  experiences  in

assessing  their  risk-perceptions.  The  earliest  stage  one  undergoes  is  when  they  realize  that  a

hazard  actually  exists  in  their  location.  This  awareness  will  lead  to  further  recognition  of  the

hazard, and realization of risks. This will be followed by the establishment of the different ways

in  which  they  will  respond  to  the  risks.  The  plans  made  are  expected  to  be  implemented  into

actions.  Ultimately,  the  actions  of  each  individuals  will  create  a  community  involvement  –  an

accomplishment that is considered the most important by Rhodes and Reinholtd (1999). However,

they  also  emphasized  that  “each  stage  [presented  in  the  model]  does  not  represent  [directly]  a

level of preparedness.” The level of preparedness and risk – perception of the people is influenced

by their experiences, beliefs, personal attributes, and sociocultural norms.

The  second  approach  is  demonstrated  by  Winter  and  Bromhead  (2012)  through  their

framework  called  Willingness  Diagram  model.  The  model  suggests  that  the  landslide  risk

acceptance  of  the  people  falls  in  a  triangular  spectrum  with  three  vertices:  the  vertex  of

willingness  to  pay,  the  vertex  of  willingness  to accept the risk, and the vertex of willingness to

affect  the  environment  in their decisions. Consequently, the model implies that the three factors

that make up the spectrum are not completely independent of one another but are interlinked and

the  decisions  of  the  people  are  open  to  alterations  when  exposed  to  different  social  practices.

Winter  and  Bromhead  (2012)  intentionally  made  this  model  for  “infrastructure  owners  and

operators,  amongst  others,  [for  them]  to  understand  how  their  approach  to  risk  management

differs from those in other regions, countries and contexts.”

G. Gaps in the Study

There are only few studies about landslide risk assessment in the Philippines. If there are,

only few are available to public. As a country located in a naturally hazard – prone region, such

studies are essential in promoting the well-being and safety of the people.

Most studies that assess the landslide risks in a certain area presented in this chapter used

a conventional tool known as the Landslide Risk Index. This study, however, provides an entirely

different  approach  in  producing landslide risk maps. Two different ways in generating landslide

risk  maps  were  conducted  by  the  researcher: one is through the use of hazard and vulnerability

map; and the other is through the landslide risk-perception of the exposed population.

H. Conceptual Framework of the Study

The  main  goal  of  the  study  revolved  around  the  concept  of  the  different production of

landslide risk maps. In this paper, the researcher aimed to generate two landslide risk maps using

two  different  approaches:  one is grounded on the more objective and the geotechnical aspect of

geography;  the  other  is  based  on  the  more  subjective,  humanistic  side  of  the  discipline.

Furthermore, in creating the two risk maps desired, adequate knowledge on the following points

is essential:

1.  The methods in creating a landslide hazard map;

2.  The techniques used in generating landslide vulnerability map, and lastly;

3.  The models that measure the risk-perception of the people on landslides.

The  significance  of  the  three  points  mentioned  above  is  explained  in  the  conceptual

framework  map (see figure 2.1). The conceptual framework of this study suggests that there are

two  possible  methods  to  create  a  landslide  risk  map.  The  first  method,  which  is  the  more

objective  and technical approach, requires two new concepts in play – the landslide hazard map

and  the  landslide  vulnerability  map.  The  landslide  hazard  map  is  produced  from  the  landslide

susceptibility  assessment  method,  wherein  future  areas  of  landslides are predicted based on the

past  landslide  occurrences  and  several  other  geotechnical  factors.  Consequently,  the  landslide

vulnerability  map  is  generated  from  the  measures  quantified  by  the  Social  Vulnerability  Index

model.  The  widespread  use  and  popularity  of  this  method  made  it  one  of  the  most  common

approach  in  creating  landslide  risk  maps  (Abella  and  Westen,  2007).  The  incessant  use  of this

method  by  many  researchers  who  have  already  conducted  studies  about  landslide  risk

assessments made this technique to become even more developed, producing more concepts that

improve the risk measures such as landslide risk indices, risk grades, and many more (Assilzadeh

et al., 2010; Dwyer et al., 2004; Pearce, 2000; Wang et al., 2013).

The  second  method,  on the other hand, is the more subjective approach that completely

runs  under  the  actual  opinions  and  perceptions  of  the  people using questions derived from two

models: preparedness model and willingness diagram. The two models serve as the handbook in

giving people ideas on how they can assess their risk-perception individually. In this method, all

measurements  and  identification  of  risks  come  from  the  concerned individuals themselves, and

not from the researchers/any other predictive statistical models.

The study aims to analyze the relationship between these two approaches, and ultimately

come  up  with  a  conclusion  that justifies the similarities and the differences that will emerge on

the process.

CHAPTER III

METHODOLOGY

This  chapter  provides  a  comprehensive  explanation on the procedures in generating the

three  types  of  map  used  in  the  study  –  (1)  one  landslide  hazard  map,  (2)  one  map  of  the

vulnerable  population  in  the  exposed  areas,  and  (3)  two  landslide  risk  maps.  This chapter also

expounds  the  procedure  on  the  analysis  of  the  landslide  risk  -  perception  and  landslide

vulnerability of the selected population in the exposed areas of the municipality.

A. Study Area

The  area  to  be  studied  comprises  the  entire  municipality  of  San  Mateo,  Rizal  –  a first

class municipality with a total land area of 55.09 km2. It is bordered by Quezon City in the west,

Marikina City and Antipolo City in the south, Antipolo City in the east, and the municipality of

Rodriguez in the north (see Figure 3.1).  The western half of the municipality is mostly flat, while

the eastern half is dominated by flat highlands, mountains, and valleys. The more urbanized areas

are located in the western part of the municipality, while the more forested areas are located in the

east. The highest point on the surface is about 453 meters, located in the east, and the lowest point

located  in  the  west  is  about  4  meters  above mean sea level. The critical difference in elevation

across  the  municipality  is  distinctly  manifested.  As one crosses the direction from west to east,

the elevation encounters an abrupt and drastic rise. Between 2000 meters to 4000 meters from the

west going to east, the elevation grade suddenly rises from 50 meters to 400 meters above mean

sea  level.  Because  of  the  extreme  change  in  altitude  (high-angled  roads),  public  transportation

from  the  municipal  center  to  the  highlands  is  very  limited.  Only  tricycles  and  private  cars

frequent  the  area,  but  the  trike  fares  are  high.  This  is  the  reason  why  most  of  the  people  that

purposely  go  to  the  eastern  part  of  the  municipality  –  either  or  leisure,  tourism,  or  residence

purposes – usually travel by car.

B. Data Collection

The data used for the study were divided into three (3) categories based on their purpose:

(1)  landslide hazard data; (2) landslide vulnerability data; and (3) landslide risk-perception data.

The acquisition of all these data is essential in accomplishing the desired objectives of the study.

Landslide Hazard Data

The  data  used  in  producing  a  landslide  hazard  map  of  the  municipality  include  the

administrative boundary, soil type, distance to road network, distance to stream drainage network,

elevation,  slope  angle  gradient,  slope  aspect,  plan  curvature,  areas  with  unstable  slope  and

landslide  inventory.  The  administrative  boundary  data  was downloaded from the website of the

Humanitarian  Data  Exchange  website  –  an  open platform for sharing data that was launched in

July  2014.  It  contains  the  indicative  boundaries  of  the  municipality  of  San  Mateo,  Rizal  as

observed  at  the  end  of  June  2016  as  per  the  Philippine  Geographic  Standard  Code  (PSGC)

dataset.  It  has  been  generated  based  on  the layers created by the Philippine Statistics Authority

(PSA)  and  National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) in the context of

the 2015 population census. The soil type data was acquired from the 2013 report of the Bureau

of  Soil  and  Water  Management  (BSWM)  on  the  correlation  of  the  Philippine  soils  into  FAO's

World  Reference  Base  for  Soil  Resources.  The  report  contained  a  soil  series  map  of  the

Philippines with a scale of 1:5,000,000 in kilometers printed on an A3-sized sheet.

The  landslide  inventory  data  was  obtained  from  Rizal  Provincial  Disaster  and  Risk

Reduction Management Office. It contains all the landslide events that have occurred between the

years  2005  and  2016.  There  are  a  total  of  18  landslide  occurrences  listed  on  the  landslide

inventory data acquired. However, its number does not meet the statistical requirement of 30 to be

able to produce meaningful results. To supplement this, the researcher produced his own landslide

inventory  using  remote  sensing.  Using  the  software  ENVI  5.3,  a  landslide  inventory  was

processed  and  derived  from  two  (2)  satellite  images  of  the  study  area  scanned  in  different

temporal periods. The two images were downloaded from the website of United States Geological

Survey. Results of the image processing were validated using the inventory from RPDRRMO.

Data on the road network of the municipality was downloaded from the open street map

updated  frequently.  The  areas  of  unstable  slopes  data  were  obtained  from  Project  Nationwide

Operational Assessment of Hazards in the University of the Philippines (UP NOAH). The data on

the stream drainage network, elevation, slope angle gradient, slope aspect, and plan curvature of

the  municipality  was  derived  from  a  resampled  Interferometric  Synthetic  Aperture  Radar

(IFSAR) digital terrain model with a 5-m spatial resolution. The IFSAR digital terrain model was

acquired from the Department of Science and Technology – University of the Philippines Disaster

Risk and Exposure Assessment for Mitigation Program (DOST – UP DREAM) LiDAR Portal for

Archiving and Distribution website.

Landslide Vulnerability Data

To assess the vulnerability of the selected people in the exposed areas in the municipality,

three classifications of vulnerability were identified in the study based on the Social Vulnerability

Index:  (1)  socioeconomic  vulnerability;  (2)  demographic  vulnerability;  (3)  and  physical

vulnerability. The information used in measuring the socioeconomic vulnerability of the selected

participants include annual income, employment status and educational attainment. On the other

hand, age, sex, civil status, and existence of disability were used as measures for the demographic

vulnerability. The physical vulnerability was evaluated using the type of house (apartment, single

building,  etc.)  and  ownership  of  a  functioning  vehicle.  All  the  data  listed  above  was  obtained

through a survey – questionnaire form.

Landslide Risk Data

Two risk maps were generated in this study, one is based on the hazard and vulnerability

map, the other is based on the risk-perception of the selected people in the exposed areas in San

Mateo.  The  data  used  in  producing  the  first  map  were  the  generated landslide hazard map and

landslide vulnerability map. On the other hand, the information needed to produce the second risk

map were risk awareness, risk perception, risk understanding, capacity, risk response orientation,

and  level  of  preparedness.  These  factors  were  derived  from  the  preparedness  model  used  as  a

theoretical framework in evaluating the landslide risk-perception of the people in the study. Each

factor was measured and scored based on their answers on the questionnaire given.

C. Participants

The  participants  in  the  study  are  the  households  or  business  establishments  currently

located  in  the  exposed  areas.  Participants  were  chosen  from  each  exposure  class  based  on  the

hazard  map.  The  researcher  was  able  to  congregate  82  households/business  establishments  as

respondents for the study – 24 were located in the no exposure, 40 in low exposure, 7 in moderate

exposure,  and  11  in  the  areas  considered  as  high  exposure. The participants were chosen using

cluster  sampling  method.  To  ensure  that  the  participants  are  accessible  for  the researcher, only

those  living  within  20  meters  away  from  the  road  were  selected.  Additionally,  the  researcher

assured that the chosen participants were already living in the municipality since the year 2004.

D. Methodological Framework of the Study

The  overall  procedure  in  accomplishing  all the objectives of the study was divided into

three  phases. The first phase incorporates all the procedures performed to generate the landslide

hazard  map.  The  second  phase  includes  all  the  methods  done  to  produce  the  landslide

vulnerability  map.  Lastly,  the  third  phase  contains  all  the  techniques  used  in  producing  and

assessing the two differently-made landslide risk maps (See figure 3.2).

First Phase – Making the Landslide Hazard Map

This  phase  includes  all the methods and procedures performed to generate the landslide

hazard map of the municipality (See figure 3.3).   The idea of the landslide hazard map produced

in the study was founded on the concept of GIS-based landslide susceptibility mapping technique.

Landslide  susceptibility  mapping  is  a  predictive  mapping  technique  that  forecasts  the  areas  of

future  landslide  occurrences  based  on  several  environmental  factors  and  previous  landslide

phenomena.

In this study, two types of data were used to create the final landslide hazard map: the (1)

landslide  inventory  and  the  (2)  different  environmental  factors.  The  landslide  inventory  was

produced using the land cover change detection technique in remote sensing. In this method, two

multispectral satellite images of the same area but different time frame were downloaded from the

website earthexplorer.usgs.gov. The WRS path and WRS row of the two multispectral images are

116 and 50 respectively. The two data have a spatial resolution of 30 meters and were projected

using the Transverse Mercator projection, with a projected coordinate system of WGS 1984 UTM

Zone  51N  based  on  a  geographic  coordinate  system  of  WGS  1984.  The  first  satellite  image

downloaded  was  scanned  on May 21. 2005 using Landsat 5 satellite with the Thematic Mapper

sensor.  Bands  used  were  bands  1-6  on  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.  On  the  other  hand,  the

second  satellite  image  downloaded  was  scanned on February 13, 2016 using Landsat 8 satellite

with  Operational  Land  Imager  (OLI)  and  Thermal  Infrared  Sensor (TIRS). The bands included

were  bands  1-7  on  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.  The  images  were  resampled  using  the  cubic

convolution algorithm.

The digital numbers (DNs) of each image were first converted to radiance, then to surface

reflectance using the radiometric calibration tool under the radiometric correction folder in ENVI

5.3.  The  spectral  signatures  of  each  land  cover  class  were  then  manually  assessed  using  the

crosshair  and  spectral  library  viewer  calibrated  by the USGS. Regions of Interests (ROIs) were

generated  on  each  identified  land  cover  classes  using  the  ROI  tool.  Five  (5)  landcover  classes

were identified by the researcher: built-up area, bare soil, vegetation, water, and clouds. The two

satellite  images  were  then  classified  using  the  maximum  likelihood  algorithm  under  the

supervised  classification  tool.  The  results  of  the  image classification were further refined using

the  majority  analysis  algorithm  under  the  post-classification  tool.  Kernel  size  used  was  5 by 5

pixels  with a pixel weight of 1. The validity of the final classified image was evaluated through

the confusion matrix using ground truth ROIs.

The  results  of  the  two  classified  satellite  images  were  further  processed  using  the

thematic change workflow tool under the change detection folder. The output of the method is the

landcover  change  that  have  occurred  in  San  Mateo  from  the  year  2005  to  the  year  2016.  The

specific  data  needed  on  the  study  –   the change from vegetation cover to bare soil cover – was

finally  acquired.  This  land  cover  change  was  validated  using  the  landslide  inventory  obtained

from  RPDRRMO.  Lastly,  the  validated  land  cover  change  was  used  as  the  landslide inventory

data for the study.

The second group of data used were the different environmental factors assumed to have

an influence on the occurrences of landslides in the municipality (see figure 3.4). The preliminary

data acquired by the researcher are the digital elevation model, soil type data, road network data,

and  unstable  slopes  data  of  the  municipality.  The  IFSAR  digital  elevation  model  with  a  5-m

spatial resolution was resampled into 30-m spatial resolution to maintain the coherence with the

landslide inventory data. The resampled result was processed into slope angle data, slope aspect

data, plan curvature data, stream drainage data, and elevation data using ArcGIS 10.2.2. The road

network  data  was  transformed  into  raster  dataset  using  the  Euclidean  distance  tool  under  the

spatial  analyst  toolbox  in  ArcMap.  The  data  enumerated  above  were  all  projected  using  the

Transverse Mercator

projection,  with  a  projected  coordinate  system  of  WGS  1984  UTM  Zone  51N  based  on  a

geographic coordinate system of WGS 1984. Afterwards, all of the data at hand were transformed

into  points  and  were  extracted  to  the  landslide inventory data using the ‘extract multi values to

points’ tool under the spatial analyst toolbox in ArcMap.

The  result  of  the  extracted  points  were  10,000 individual values each having a specific

combination of factors included. These values were entered in IBM SPSS Statistics 20 as inputs.

Logistic  regression  and  artificial  neural  network  were  used  to  identify  and  evaluate  the

relationship  between  the  environmental  factors  and  the  landslide  inventory  data,  consequently

producing  weights.  In  the  statistical  analyses,  the  environmental  factors  were  appointed  as  the

independent  variables,  and  the  landslide inventory data was assigned as the dependent variable.

The dependent variable is a binary variable that has only a value of ‘landslide’ or ‘no landslide’.

‘No landslide’ information was represented as 1, and the ‘landslide’ information was represented

as 2. The independent variables, on the other hand, were further classified into two kinds of data

according  to  their  values:  continuous  data  and  categorical  data.  Continuous  data are those data

whose values include floating numbers. The factors that were considered as continuous data were

slope  angle,  plan  curvature,  and  elevation.  On  the  other  hand,  categorical  data  are  those  data

whose values are only limited to integers. Factors that fell under the categorical data were the soil

type, unstable slopes, slope aspect, road distance, and stream drainage distance. However, values

of  these  categorical  data  are  all  string  and  nominal  –  variable  formats  that  cannot  be  read  by

logistic regression analysis and ANN analysis. Because of this, dummy variables were assigned to

each values to represent the string variables as numeric data (see appendix 3.1).  Before running

the  two  statistical  tests,  presence  of  multicollinearity  was  evaluated  using  the  collinearity

tolerance  and  variance  inflation  factor.  Afterwards,  the  prepared  data  were  entered  in  the

regression and neural network option under the analyze menu in IBM SPSS Statistics 20.

The  type  of  regression  used  in  the  study  was  binary  logistic  regression.  The  specific

method used was stepwise selection – a method that makes the model run in different number of

steps. The figures were divided into two datasets, train and test data set. The training data set was

randomly  assigned  with  70%  of  the  population of the data, while the test data set was assigned

with  the  remaining  30%.  On  the  other  hand,  the  specific  neural  network  approach  used  in  the

study  was  multilayer  perceptron  technique.  A  standardized  rescaling  of  covariates  was

implemented. Similar to logistic regression, the training data set in this method consists of 70% of

the population of the data, while the test data set was also assigned with the remaining 30%. The

number  of  hidden  layer  used  was  1.  The  optimization  algorithm  used  was  scaled  conjugate

gradient. The total number of units analyzed is 43. The number of units in the hidden layer is 7.

The activation function used in the hidden layer was Hyperbolic tangent. The activation function

in  the  output  layer, on the other hand, was Softmax. The error function used was cross-entropy.

The  two  statistical techniques were run separately using the same set of data. Consequently, the

results of both tests were cross-validated using the saved predicted set of values, and the accuracy

of the results were assessed using confusion matrix and AUROC curve.

Each  of  the  statistical  techniques  performed  generated  an  equation  that  represents  the

relationship of the dependent and the independent variables with the residuals. The two equations

were  then  entered  separately  in  the ArcMap using the raster calculator under the spatial analyst

toolbox.  The  results  showed  two  visually  -  different  maps  –  one  is  produced  via  logistic

regression, one is created via artificial neural network. Ultimately, the two maps were combined

using the same tool to generate one final hazard map.

In  post-processing  the  final  map,  the  entire  municipality  was  divided  into  four  classes

based  on  their  exposure  to  hazard:  no  exposure,  low  exposure,  moderate  exposure,  and  high

exposure. The classification method used was natural breaks (jenks).

Second Phase – Making the Landslide Vulnerability Map

Data on the vulnerability of the selected people in the exposed areas in the municipality

were gathered through a survey-questionnaire form distributed during the house-to-house survey.

Specific information asked by the questionnaire for the generation of landslide vulnerability map

include  annual  income,  employment  status,  educational  attainment,  age,  crowding,  civil  status,

existence of disability, type of house, and ownership of a functioning vehicle.

There are a total of 82 respondents each with their own responses obtained from the field

activity. The absolute location of the households/business establishments of the respondents were

recorded using a mobile application called GPS Essentials. The vulnerability of each respondents

were assessed using the Social Vulnerability Index (see table 3.2). Three different SVI measures

were  used  in  the  study,  namely  physical  vulnerability,  socio-economic  vulnerability,  and

demographic  vulnerability.  In  this  study,  each  three SVI measures were given three (3) specific

standards  to  identify  vulnerability.  These  nine  (9)  different  specific  standards  were  used  as

measures  for  the  vulnerability  of  each  respondent.  The  vulnerability  score  of  each  participant

were measured for every standards requirements met – that is, zero means the lowest vulnerability

grade and nine is the highest vulnerability grade. Additionally, if a respondent scored 2 out of 3 in

each  SVI  measures,  then  he/she  is  considered  as  vulnerable  in  that  field.  The  SVI-measured

vulnerability  data,  along  with  the  GPS  locations  of  each  respondents, were then mapped in the

ArcMap as points. Kernel density was used to show the areas of concentration of the vulnerable

population in the municipality. The output cell size used was 15 with a 500 – meter search radius.

The  resulting  density  map  was  then  divided  into  four  classes  using  natural  breaks  as  the

classification method.

Third Phase – Making the Landslide Risk Maps

The  final  phase  of  the  entire  methodological  framework  involved  all  the  process

conducted  in  generating  the  two  landslide risk maps. The first risk map was produced from the

final  landslide  hazard  map  (LHM)  and  the  final landslide vulnerability map (LVM) (See figure

3.5). Using the combine tool under the spatial analyst toolbox, the LHM and LVM were merged

into  one  raster  file,  ultimately  resulting  to  the  first  landslide  risk  map  (LRM).  The  LRM  was

classified into 16 different classes, including the classes from the LHM and LVM. However, the

classes pertaining to the measures of landslide risk are only divided into four.

The  second  risk  map  was produced solely from the risk-perceptions of the respondents.

Questions  included  in  the  survey-questionnaire  form  were  generated  with  the  help  of  the

preparedness model and willingness diagram. Risk-perception factors asked by the questionnaire

include  landslide  awareness,  recognition  of  risks,  level  of  understanding,  capacity  to  respond,

response orientation, and risk perception (see table 3.3). All these data are categorical binary data

with  nominal  values,  hence,  dummy  variables  were  also  used.  All  variables  used  were

transformed into numbers 1 and 2.  Landslide awareness was graded using two variable measures:

unaware (1) or aware (2). The variable measures used in the recognition of risks was unknown (1)

or known (2). On the other hand, the measures used in the level of understanding were unrealistic

(1) or realistic (2). The capacity to respond was measured using the lack of resources to combat

the hazard (1) or the presence of resources (2). Response orientation was measured as reactive (1)

or  pro-active  (2).  The  willingness  action  was  further  divided  into  three  closed  questions.  Each

risk-perception  factor  questions  were  asked  using  the  multiple-choice  format.  However,  blank

lines  were  incorporated  to  provide  the  respondents  the  freedom  to  explain  reasons  and

justifications.

Further analysis was made to supplement the qualitative answers using possible statistical

information. Logistic regression was used to extract statistical explanations on the risk-perception

answers  of  the  respondents.   Also,  the  respondents  were  assessed  and  classified  into  the  three

types of risk-attitudes based on their answers. The three risk attitudes identified were: risk averse,

risk  seeker,  and  risk  neutral.  Finally, the two landslide risk maps produced were compared, and

reflections by the researcher were provided.

E. Ethical Considerations

Practicing  the  best  method  requires  the  right  approaches  and  ethical  considerations.  In

this  study,  the  participants  were  given  brief  information  about  the  study,  and  a  consent  form

attached  at  the  front  page  of  the questionnaire. Participants were also informed beforehand that

the  claimed  exposure  of  their  location  is  only  based  on  the  hazard  map  produced  by  the

researcher.

F. Research Instruments

The  final  landslide  hazard  map  was  generated  using  three  softwares:  ArcGIS  10.2.2,

ENVI  5.3,  and  IBM  SPSS  Statistics  20.  Two  hazard  maps  were  primarily  produced,  before

combining  it  to  become  the  final hazard map. One hazard map was created through the logistic

regression  method,  and  the  other  one  was  produced  using the artificial neural network method.

Their  validity  was  assessed  using  the  confusion  matrix  table  and  through  comparing  their

respective Area Under the Remote Operating Characteristic curve.

The  landslide  vulnerability  map  was  based  on  the  results  of  social  vulnerability  index

conducted through the house-to-house survey. In the social vulnerability index, three (3) measures

were used: socioeconomic vulnerability, demographic vulnerability, and physical vulnerability. If

a  participant  was  identified  as  vulnerable  in  the  two  out  of  the  three  vulnerability  measures,

he/she has been considered as vulnerable. The location of the exposed population was mapped as

points, and each point was classified into vulnerable or invulnerable based on their answer scores

evaluated in the social vulnerability index.

The  risk  maps  were  produced  using  two  different  methods:  quantitative  and

semi-qualitative.  The  quantitative  map  was  based  on  GIS-based  analyses  and  quantitative

methods.  It  was  produced  through  combining  the  statistically  –  generated  hazard  map  and  the

surveyed  vulnerability  map  using

the  raster  calculator

tool

in  ArcMap  10.2.2.  The

semi-qualitative  map,  on  the  other  hand,  was  founded  more  on  the  humanistic  approach  of

landslide risk assessments through the acquisition of the risk-perceptions of the exposed people in

San Mateo. Additionally, the location of the exposed population was mapped as points, and each

point was classified into high risk or low risk based on their own perceptions materialized on the

questionnaire.

CHAPTER IV

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

This  chapter  presents  the  results  of  the  methods  and  techniques  conducted  for  the

accomplishment of the research objectives. This chapter also discusses these results and provides

comprehensive  analyses  and  interpretations  on  outcomes through various means such as charts,

tables, figures, and paragraphs.

1. First Phase Results and Discussions

This  section presents and analyzes all the results of the processes conducted to generate

the  final  landslide  hazard  map.  Specific  methods  and  justifications  used  in  processing  the  two

essential  groups  of  data in the map – landslide inventory and environmental factors – were also

examined.

A. Generating the Landslide Inventory

The visual results of the image classification performed on the two satellite images used

in  the  study  showed  that there is a huge change from vegetation class to soil class detected just

within the 11-year interval (see figure 4.1.1).

.

These  classified  images,  however,  are  just  pretty  pictures  without  the  accuracy

assessment.  Assessment  of  the  accuracy  of  the  image  classification  performed  in  the  study  is

essential in establishing the credibility and reliability of the land covers identified in the method.

The overall accuracy, as well as the kappa coefficient of the image classification results of the two

satellite images are shown in table 4.1.1.

Overall Accuracy: 99.1962

Kappa Coefficient: 0.9981

The  total  accuracy  of  the  image  classification  performed  on  the  first  image scanned in

2005  is  99.1025%.  On  the  other  hand,  the  total  accuracy  of  the second image taken in 2016 is

99.1962%.  The  total  or  overall  accuracy  in  the confusion matrix is calculated as the number of

correct plots divided by the total number of the plots. A value of almost a hundred percent greatly

suggests the near to perfect accuracy of the two classifications made. The total accuracy, however,

just  only  represents  the  average  of  the  summary  value  of  all  classes.  To  further  evaluate  the

accuracy  of  each  land  cover  classes,  the  producer’s  accuracy  and  user’s  accuracy  have  been

included in the analysis.

Producer’s  accuracy  is  the  degree  of  the accuracy of the map from the producer, or the

map maker’s point of view. User’s accuracy, on the other hand, refers to the map accuracy of the

classified image from the perspective of the user, or the literal reader of the map. This study only

focused  on  the  two  land  cover  classes  identified,  namely  vegetation  and  soil.  The  producer’s

accuracy  of  the  first  classified  image  on  the  vegetation  class  cover  is  99.84%  while  the  other

image  has  99.42%.  The  user’s  accuracy  of  both  maps  on  the  said land cover class is also very

high, with a 99.96% on the first map, and 97.95% on the second map. A 99% accuracy means that

99% of the time, the algorithm used is correctly plotting the exact landcover classification based

on  the  validating ground truth ROIs used. High accuracy on the vegetation means that there are

no other land cover classes incorrectly classified as vegetation, or vice versa. The accuracy of the

soil  class,  on  the  other  hand,  varies  in  each  type  of  accuracy  and  map  date.  The  producer’s

accuracy  on  the  first  image  is  70.92%  while  its  user’s  accuracy  is 98.26%. This result became

contrasted  with  that  of  the second image, which has a 91.38% producer’s accuracy and 76.24%

user’s  accuracy.  The  possible  explanation  for  this  relatively  lower  accuracy  is  the  slight

distinctiveness of the soil class with the built-up areas. The producer’s accuracy of the first image

on soil is relatively low because there are many soil class pixels mixed with the cluster of built-up

areas  pixels,  possibly  forcing  the  producer  to  commit  errors  in  identifying  classes.  The  user’s

accuracy  of  the  second  image  on  the soil class is low because there are now few built-up areas

mixed  with  the  cluster  of  soil  pixels,  possibly  making  the  user  commit  errors  similar  with  the

first’s.

The  last  measure  of  classification  accuracy  is  the  kappa  coefficient.  The  κ  coefficient

measures  the  agreement  between  classification  and  ground  truth  pixels.  A kappa value  of  1

represents a perfect agreement while a value of 0 represents no agreement at all.

Kappa  coefficient  is  calculated as the ratio of the difference between the observed accuracy

and the chance agreement and the difference between 1 and the chance agreement. In the equation

projected  above,  i pertains  the  class  number,  N is  the  total  number  of  classified  pixels  that are

being  compared to ground truth ROIs, mi,i is the number of pixels belonging to the ground truth

class i  that  have  also  been classified with a class i, Gi is the total number of ground truth pixels

belonging to class I, and Ci is the total number of classified pixels belonging to class i. With a κ

coefficient  of  0.9830  and  0.9981  respectively,  the  two  classified  Landsat images taken in 2005

and  2016  almost  achieved  a  near  perfect  agreement  between  the  classification  results  and  the

ground truth ROIs, suggesting a more credible and accurate land cover classification class used as

one of the preliminary data in the study.

After  the  accuracy  assessment,  change  detection  method  was  performed  using  the  two

classified  images.  The  result  of  this  method  showed  that  most  of  the  land  cover changes from

vegetation  to  soil  have  occurred  in  the  western  part  of  the  municipality,  where  the  forests and

mountains are located (see figure 4.1.2). The amount of vegetation cover that turned to soil from

May 2005 to February 2011 in the municipality is 56.881% (see appendix). More than half of the

entire land area covered with vegetation in 2005 was transformed into soil in 2016.

As  what  has  been  discussed  in  the  methodology,  these  detected  changes  were  used  as  the

landslide inventory in the study. However, this study does not suggest that landslides alone caused

these  land  cover  changes  to  occur,  as  there  have  also  been detected road networks in the same

uplands  (see  figure  4.1.3).  It  can  be  noticed  that  the  road  network  and  the detected land cover

changes  considered  as  landsides  that  have  occurred  in  San  Mateo  coincided  well, suggesting a

more obvious explanation of their relationship. Roads can serve as an indicator of the existence of

human  activities,  as  it  connects  and  makes  up  the  networks  of  such.  For  this  reason,  it can be

assumed  that  the  cause  of  the  detected  land  cover  changes  does  not  necessarily  pertain  to

landslides, but to human activities as well. The fact that there are already existing infrastructures

in the area suggests the possibility that human activities could be one of the main contributors of

these  detected  land  cover  changes.  However,  there are no current possible ways to identify and

separate  the  changes  caused  by  the  landslides,  and the changes caused by the human activities.

Nevertheless, a 100% assurance was still made confirming that all these changes include that of

the landslides.

B. Statistical Analyses using Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network

i.  Multicollinearity Test

The two statistical methods used to predict the future occurrences of the landslides in the

municipality are logistic regression and artificial neural network models. These models examine

the  relationship  between a dependent variable and a set of independent variables. Consequently,

in  predictive  analyses,  the  absolute  independence  of  each  independent  factors  must  first  be

measured  to  avoid  the  redundancy  of  the  data.  One  way  of  checking  this  is  through  the

multicollinearity tests. In the study, the VIF and tolerance were used as the measurements of such

errors.  The  standard  cut-off  used  for  variance  inflation  factor  (VIF)  measure  was  5,  and  the

standard cut-off used for the tolerance was 0.2. A VIF measure of more than 5, with a tolerance of

less than 0.2, indicates the presence of multicollinearity between independent variables.

The results of the multicollinearity test performed on the different environmental factors

showed that there is no multicollinearity between the independent variables (see table 4.1.2).  The

highest VIF in the variables is 2.663, a figure less than 5. On the other hand, the lowest tolerance

value  is  0.376, a magnitude still higher than 0.2. This denotes that all the independent variables

can be inputted in the logistic regression and artificial neural network analyses.

ii.

Logistic Regression

The population of the training data set randomly chosen for logistic regression analysis is

6988,  and  the  population  of  the  test  data  set  is  3012.  One  of  the  measures  to  explain  the

relationship of the dependent and the independent variables in regression analyses is the r square.

The  concept  of  R2 signifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable associated with

the  independent  variables.  The  minimum  value  of  r  squares  is  0, and the maximum value is 1.

Larger  R2  values  means  larger  part  of  the  variation  between  the predicted and the predictors is

explained by the model. In the study, the results of the Nagelkerke R2 of the train data set is 0.823

while  the  test’s  is  0.832  (see  table  4.1.3).  Generally,  these  r  squares  signify  that  80%  of  the

variation  between  the  dependent  variable  is  explained  by  the  different  independent  variables

involved. On the other hand, Cox & Snell R2 simply displays the relationship of the variability of

the  dependent  variables  and  the  independent  variables  had  the  data  been  analyzed  using linear

regression.  The  -2  Log  Likelihood  just  explains the relationship between the distribution of the

data and the likelihood to produce the desired observed data. In this study, the -2 Log likelihood

of  the  two groups of data have a high magnitude relative to its population size. A high value of

the -2 Log Likelihood basically means that the model produced is pretty much reliable.

The  actual  weights  of  each  independent  variables  to  the  dependent  variables,  their

significance, standard errors, and many more are shown in table 4.1.4. It is important to note that

the resulting significant factors in the two data sets produced different results. For a variable to be

significant,  its  p  –  value  under  the  “SIG”  column  must  be  less  than  0.05.  A  value  showing

otherwise is considered as insignificant, and therefore removed from the model. The results from

the  regression  analyses  performed  in  the  study  showed  that  all  factors  were  significant  in  the

model. The weights, however, were different in the two groups. Weights, or the coefficients (B),

indicate  the  strength  and  kind  of  relationship  of  each  independent  variable  to  the  dependent

variable. In the train dataset, slope has the highest coefficient, followed by the road, and then the

elevation.  Curvature  has  the  lowest  coefficient  among  the  variables.  Out  of  all  the  eight

predictors,  only  soil  and  curvature  have  a  negative/inverse  relationship  with  the  predicted

variables. This means that as these two variables increase or decrease, the predicted variable goes

otherwise.  This  same  pattern  of  the  result  is  seen  in the test dataset. Slope, road, and elevation

have also emerged as the top three heaviest independent variables. However, the aspect has now

become  negative.  In  this  study,  the  train  dataset  is used as the framework of the model since it

was processed using most of the data.

There are other factors listed on the table above. The standard error is an alternative way

of  viewing  or  assessing  the  goodness-of-fit  of  the  model.  Generally,  in  regression  models,

standard  errors  become  smaller  the  closer  the  points  are  to  the  line.  It  indicates  the  average

distance that the predictor values fall from the regression graph. In the study, almost all predictors

have an S.E less than 1. This suggests the reliability of the model in terms of goodness-of-fit.

The degrees of freedom represent the total number of values in the model that are free to

vary.  All  the  independent  variables  have  a  DF  of  1.  The  Wald  statistics,  on  the  other  hand,

evaluates  what  independent  variables  contribute  to  the  model  and  what  do  not.  It  the  Wald

statistics  is  zero  or  near  zero,  then  the  independent  variable  can  be  removed  from  the  model

without affecting the overall performance of the model. In this study, every variable contributes to

the  model.  Lastly,  the  exponential  of  the  coefficient,  or  the  EXP(B)  column,  only  displays the

coefficients of each predictors in exponential form.

In this study, an equation that translates all the result into a single framework is produced

from the logistic regression output. The final equation of derived from the produced model is:

Final Map = 0.855 + (0.897*Slope) + (0.599*Road) + (0.209*Elevation) + (0.115*Unstable Slopes) + (0.080*Aspect)

+ (0.011*Stream) – (0.967*Soil) – (1.124*Curvature)

The final map produced from the equation above is processed using ArcGIS 10.2.2 raster

calculator tool. The areas that fell on the “very low exposure” classification are generally located

in the western part of the municipality. The next three classes of exposure, on the other hand, are

randomly distributed in the eastern half of San Mateo.   It is also important to note that there are

very  low  susceptible  areas  mixed  with  the  other  three  classes  in  some  parts  of  the  central and

eastern municipality (see figure 4.1.4).

iii.  Artificial Neural Network – Multilayer Perceptron

The  population  of  the  training  data  set  randomly  chosen  for  the  ANN-MP  analysis  is

6950, and the population of the test data set is 3050. The general structure of the model consists

of  three  layers:  input  layer,  hidden  layer,  and  output  layer  (see  figure  4.1.5).  A  bias  layer was

included in the input and hidden layer to serve as controls. A total of 43 units was included in the

input  layer,  7 units in the hidden layer, and 2 units in the output layer. The data on the unstable

slope was not included by the algorithm because of significance issues.

The  general  summary  of  the  performance  of  the  is  shown  in  table  4.1.5.  The  cross

entropy  error  is  used  because  the  output  layer  used  the softmax activation function. This is the

error  function  that  the  network  tries  to  minimize  during  the  analyses.  The  percent  incorrect

predictions  are  taken  from  the  confusion  matrix  of the final performance evaluation table. Low

incorrect predictions mean high accuracy and credibility of the model made. In this study, there is

about 7% incorrect predictions made in the training and test datasets. This low value suggests that

the model created has a significant accuracy in predicting values.

The stopping rule used describes the approach of the model in the prediction performed.

Based  on  the  table  above,  1  consecutive  step  was  performed  without  controlling  the  errors

calculated using the testing sample. The total training time indicates the total time it took for the

model  to  complete  the  analyses.  The  detailed  values  calculated  for  each  independent  variable

used in the model is shown in appendix 4.1.

Unlike the coefficients produced by the logistic regression, the weights generated in this

model  have  a  different  order. Based on table 4.1.6, soil has the highest importance of the seven

independent variables included in the model. Elevation and slope have almost equal importance.

Stream  has  the  least  importance  in  the  set.  The  weights  produced  by  ANN-ML  model  do  not

provide a description on the relationship of the independent variables and the dependent variables

(direct or inverse). It only gives the importance of each to the predicted figures.

In this study, an equation that translates all the result into a single framework is produced

from the logistic regression output. The final equation of derived from the produced model is:

Final Map =  (0.211*Slope) + (0.087*Road) + (0.212*Elevation) + (0.052*Aspect) + (0.029*Stream) + (0.290*Soil) +

(0.119*Curvature)

The final map produced from the equation above is processed using ArcGIS 10.2.2 raster

calculator  tool.  The  hazard  map  produced  using  ANN-ML  looked  very similar with that of the

hazard map produces using logistic regression (see figure 4.1.6). The areas that fell on the “very

low  exposure”  classification  are  generally  located  in  the  western  part  of  the  municipality.  The

next three classes of exposure, on the other hand, are randomly distributed in the eastern half of

San Mateo. Also, like that of the previous map, there are very low susceptible areas mixed with

the other three classes in some parts of the central and eastern municipality. It is important to note

that  unlike  the  first  map  generated,  this  map  looked  cleaner  and  more  refined.  Visually,  the

accuracy of this map is higher because there are no susceptibilities in the flat lands (western part)

of the municipality, unlike that of the result of the logistic regression-base hazard map.

iv.  Accuracy Assessments using Confusion Matrix and AUROC Curve

The accuracy of each model performed were evaluated using the confusion matrix and the

AUROC  curve.  The  confusion  matrix  of  the  logistic  regression  is  shown  in  table  4.1.7.  Both

datasets have an overall percentage of more than 90% in the prediction performance of the model.

The observed column consists of the actual classification of the dependent variable. The predicted

column, on the other hand, is composed of the “guessed” classification of the model based on the

different  combination  of  independent  variables.  The  intersection  of  the  “absence”  and  the

“presence” classes indicate the correct prediction of the model based on the observed data. In the

training  dataset,  3333  out  of the 3510 population of the “presence of landslides” were correctly

predicted by the model, hence, garnering a 94.9 percent accuracy. Out of 3475 population of the

“absence  of  landslides”,  3083  were  correctly  predicted,  thus  acquiring  an  accuracy  of  88.7%.

Similarly,  the  percentage  of  the correct prediction of the absence and the presence of landslides

using the test data set are both high, suggesting that the model performed well in prediction.

The overall percentage of the logistic regression model on the two datasets both exceeded

90%,  a  feat  that  really  describes  the  reliability  and  accuracy  of  the  model.  The  final  overall

percentage used in the study is 92%.

The confusion matrix of the ANN – MP is shown in table 4.1.8. Like the accuracy of the

logistic regression model, ANN – MP has correctly predicted 90% of the observed values of the

dependent  variable.  However,  the  actual  breakdown  of  the  overall  percentage  of  the  predicted

absence  and  presence of landslides were included in the confusion matrix of below. The overall

percentage displayed above should be equal to 100%. However, because of the percentage of the

incorrect  predictions  performed,  the final overall percentage of the correctly predicted values in

the training and test data set are 92.6% and 92.8% respectively. The final overall percentage used

in the study is 92.7%.

The confusion matrices of the two models are further compared using the AUROC curve.

AUROC  curve  (see  figure  4.1.7).  AUROC  curves,  or  Area  under  the  remote  operating

characteristic curves, provide a means of comparison between the predictive capabilities of binary

classification  models.  This  is  the  graphic  form  of  the  confusion  matrix,  in  which only the true

positive rate and the false positive rate are shown.

In the figure above, it can be visually presumed that the AUROC curve of the ANN-MP

model  is  slightly  higher  than  the  AUROC  curve  of the logistic regression model. True positive

rate  pertains  to  the  probability  of  the  value  of  the  dependent  variable  to  be  predicted  as

“presence”  when  its  true  value  is  actually “presence”. On the contrary, false positive rate is the

probability  of  the  value  of  the  dependent  variable  to  be  predicted  as  “presence”  when  its  true

value  is  actually  “absence”.  In  the  graph,  the reference line serves as the minimum limit of the

AUROC. Following that line means that the AUROC of a curve is zero, and no probabilities are

certain.

An  AUROC  curve  is  lowest  on  the  reference  line,  because  it  means  that  100%  of  the

time, the probability of the predicted value to be correct is 50%. This is no different than tossing a

coin. On the other hand, the AUROC curve is most accurate in the 1.0 of the true positive rate. In

the  results  of  the  confusion  matrices  of  the  two  models,  the  AUROC  curve  of  the  logistic

regression  model  is  0.92  and  the  AUROC  curve  of  ANN-MP  is  0.927  (see  table  4.1.9).  This

means  that  100%  of  the  time,  there  is  a  92%  probability  for  a  “presence”  to  be  predicted  as

“presence”  in  the  logistic  regression,  and  there  is  a  92.7%  probability  for  a  presence  to  be

predicted as “presence” in the ANN-MP.

Both models are significant since their p-values (SIG) are less than 0.05. The lower and

the upper bounds on the table pertain to the overall percentages of the train and test datasets of the

two models.

The  final  hazard  map  was  generated  through  averaging  the  two  hazard maps produced

using  different  statistical  models.  It  was  classified  into four classes based on the researcher: no

susceptibility,  low  susceptibility,  moderate  susceptibility,  and  high  susceptibility  (see  figure

4.1.8). Most of the areas with no susceptibility are located in low altitude areas in the western part

of  the  municipality.  The  high  susceptibility  areas  are  concentrated  in  the  center  and  the  east

because  of  the  mountainous  profile  of  San  Mateo.  There  are  no highly susceptible areas in the

southernmost part of the municipality. It can also be noticed that the areas that are not susceptible

to  landslides  in  the  southern  and  eastern  part  of  the  municipality  are  relatively  lowlands,

specifically plains and valleys.

The  four  classes  are  almost  equal  in  sizes  in  terms  of  their  total  areal  extent  in  the

municipality (see figure 4.1.9). The exact figures are shown in table 4.1.10.

The areas that are not susceptible to landslides make up 26.03% of the municipality. This

areal  extent  does  not  go  far  with  the  total  area  of  the  highly  susceptible  areas  which  occupy

24.23% of the municipality. On the other hand, almost 30% of the municipal area are moderately

susceptible  to  landslides,  and  the  smallest  part  of  the  municipality  are  lowly  susceptible to the

landslide hazards which only occupy 20.05% of San Mateo.

2. Second Phase Results and Discussions

This  section presents and analyzes all the results of the processes conducted to generate

the final landslide vulnerability map. The results and outputs of the Social Vulnerability Index are

also discussed in this part.

Results  of  the  SVI-based  questionnaire  showed that the vulnerable households/business

establishments on the three SVI measures vary (see table 4.2.1). Based on the results, only 5 out

of the 82 respondents are physically vulnerable, while the remaining 77 are not. The results of the

socio-economic  vulnerability,  on  the  other  hand,  showed  53  out  of  the  82  respondents  are

socio-economically vulnerable, while the remaining 29 are invulnerable. Lastly, the demographic

vulnerability  measure  showed  that  61  people  are  vulnerable,  and  the 21 remaining respondents

are not.

The  figures  above  are  further  visualized  in  figure  4.2.1.  It  can be noticed that the ratio

between  the  vulnerable  and  the  invulnerable  population  of  the  respondents  in  the  three  SVI

measures  are  extremely  different.  In  the  physical  vulnerability,  there  is  a  considerably  higher

number of invulnerable population compared to the number of vulnerable. On the other hand, the

number  of  the  socio-economically  vulnerable  respondents  make  up  more  than  half  of  the

population. Furthermore, the number of the demographically vulnerable respondents are the exact

opposite  of  the  population  distribution  of the physically vulnerable people. Unlike the first SVI

measure discussed, the number if the demographically vulnerable people almost exceeded the ¾

of the entire population of the respondents.

The final vulnerability decision, however, is based on the three SVI measures given. If a

respondent was considered vulnerable in one SVI measure, but invulnerable in the two remaining

measures, then he/she will be deemed as invulnerable. Based on the results of the survey, most of

the  respondents  were  considered  as  physically  invulnerable.  However,  they  were considered as

vulnerable  in  the  two  remaining  SVI  measures,  hence,  they  were  identified  as  vulnerable. The

respondents  may  have  a  strong  and  tough  foundation  for  their  houses,  but  their  inner  cultural

structures  and  demographic  conditions  are  not.  Most  of  the  respondents  were  demographically

vulnerable, specifically because of age (64 years old and above) and civil status (No spouse).

The final landslide vulnerability map shows that most of the vulnerable respondents were

concentrated in the southern part of the municipality (see figure 4.2.2). Unfortunately, that area of

high  concentration  is  where  the  previous  landslides  shown  in  the  news  have  mostly  occurred.

Most  of  the  respondents  living  there  are  socio-economically  and  demographically  vulnerable.

Note  that  there  are  vulnerable  respondents  on  the  flat  lands  despite  the  absence  of  landslide

hazards in the area. This is because the SVI measures the vulnerability of the people to all kinds

of hazards, not just landslide. Most of these said respondents are physically vulnerable (crowding)

and  demographically  vulnerable  (age  and  civil  status).  Another  thing  to  notice  hear  are  the

absence  of  vulnerability  gradient  in  the  central  part  of  the  map  where  some  respondents  are

located.  The  landslide  hazard  map visually shows that this part of the map is prone to high and

moderate  landslide  susceptibilities.  The  results  of  the  survey  showed  that  the  people  living  in

these areas are not vulnerable. As what has been said in the description of the study area, that part

of  the  municipality  are  remote  to  the  flat lands. Because of the extreme difference between the

altitude, only few vehicles frequent the area. Only private cars and expensive trike rides exist in

the area, hence, people who do not have the means to pay or have their own cars have a difficulty

to access the areas above. This gives us the conclusion that most of the people living in the area

are extremely rich. True enough, there are wealthy subdivisions in the area such as Filinvest and

Amiya Raya that houses several affluent and prosperous residents. Most of them were identified

as  invulnerable  to  all  of  the  three  SVI  measures,  hence  their  classification  as  not  vulnerable

respondents in the map.

The total number of the vulnerable and the invulnerable respondents in the municipality

are shown in table 4.2.2 and their visual comparison is shown in figure 4.2.3. Based on the table

below,  only  29  out  of  the  82  respondents  were  considered  as  not  vulnerable,  and  53  were

vulnerable  and  unsafe.  This  poses  a  fundamental  problem  to  the  respondents  because  of  the

current condition of the municipality on landslide hazards.

3. Third Phase Results and Discussions

This  section presents and analyzes all the results of the processes conducted to generate

the  two  landslide  risk  maps.  This  part  also  discusses  and  analyzes  the  advantages  and

disadvantages between the two maps produced.

A. Landslide Risk Map based on the Physical Approach

The  result  of  the  combination  of  the  final  landslide  hazard  map and the final landslide

vulnerability map is shown in figure 4.3.1. It is important to note that the landslide vulnerability

map  used  as  one  of  the  main  factors  to  produce  the  landslide  risk  map  below  only  shows  the

magnitude  of  concentration  of  the  vulnerable  respondents.  This  means  that  the lowest value of

color  in  the  legend  only  represents  the  areas  of  the  lowest  concentration  of  the  vulnerable

respondents.  Likewise,  this  also  means  that  the  highest  value  of  color  in  the  legend  only

represents  the  areas  of  high  population  density  of  the  vulnerable  respondents.  kind  of  map  is

called a heat density map – a map that displays the distribution of the population in an area. This

fact  implies  that  because  the  landslide  vulnerability  map  used  is  a  heat  density  map,  then  the

product  called  the  landslide risk map is also a heat density map as well. Furthermore, this must

not  be  mistaken  to  the  other  types  of  maps,  say  for  example,  the  landslide  hazard map, which

normally displays the location of the entities in a space using boundaries, and the existence of the

studied entities inside the delineated boundaries mean that the they have the properties delineated

by the very boundary they are in.

For instance, the map above is a heat density map that shows the areas of concentration of

the  respondents  at  risk  and  otherwise.  Notice  that  there  are  black  points,  which  symbolize  the

people who are not at risk, in the violet areas labeled as “low risk” in the legend. Despite the fact

that  they  are  on  the  space  identified  in  the  map  as  “low  risk”,  they  are  still  considered  as

respondents who are not at risk. This is because the violet-colored areas labeled as low risk only

represents  the  density  of  the  people who are at risk in the area, and do not serve as a boundary

that  delineates  who  are  at  risk  and  who  are  not. Moreover, this specifically means that the low

risk  meant  by  the  map  legend  is  really  meant  as  the  areas  who  have  low  concentration  of

respondents at risk (be it high risk or low risk).

The  respondents  at  risk,  on  the  other hand, were calculated using their exposure on the

landslide  hazard  map  and  their  vulnerability.  This  implies  that  the  respondents  who  are

considered as “no risk” shown on the map have either invulnerability or no exposure to landslide

hazards. For instance, all the respondents located on the low lands are considered as safe and not

at risk despite the fact that some respondents are shown as vulnerable in the previous map. This is

because  they  are  not  exposed  to  any  landslide  hazards  based  on  the  landslide  hazard  map

generated.

  Finally,  the  results  of  the  first  landslide  risk  map  produced  showed  that  there  are  44

(53.7%) respondents who are at risk and 38 (46.3%) respondents who are identified as not having

any risk at all (see table 4.3.1 and figure 4.3.2). This result, however, does not necessarily assure

the one hundred percent safety condition of those people classified as “no risk” since the method

used in generating the risk map has many flaws and limitations.

The table above summarizes the total number of people who answered what choice based

on  the  questionnaire  form  derived  using  the  preparedness  model.  The  figures  are  further

visualized in figure 4.3.3. Landslide awareness assesses the overall knowledge of the respondents

about the landslides that have occurred in the municipality. Out of the 82 respondents, 75 said that

they  are  currently  aware  of  the  existence  of  landslides  hazards in the municipality. Since all of

them were already residing in San Mateo since 2004, all of them are aware of the locations of the

landslides that have occurred in the municipality between 2005 and 2016. They are also aware of

the damages done by these disasters. However, 7 respondents considered themselves unaware of

the  landslides  phenomena  since  they  are  out  of  the  town  most  of  the  time,  or  seldom  watch

television. Also, even though they are aware of the few landslides that have occurred lately, they

still don’t know the exact details of the events.

Recognition  of  landslide  risks,  on  the  other  hand,  evaluates  the  acceptance  of  the

respondents of the risks they are currently taking. The results of the survey showed that all of the

respondents accept the current risks they are facing. Most of them reasoned their choice with the

fact that San Mateo, or the province of Rizal in general, is a mountainous province and landslides

are inevitable. Also, some of them said that, up until the latest landslide that occurred last March

26, they were not afraid of the risks. However, they said that they are already starting to recognize

the  real dangers of the threat because of the recorded death on the said landslide event. Had the

event last March not caused any deaths, they would have not recognized the current risks they are

facing.

The third factor used in the survey questionnaire measures the extent of knowledge of the

respondents  on  the  concepts  of  landslides.  Out  of  the  82  respondents,  45  answered  realistic

descriptions,  while  the  remaining  37 answered unrealistic concepts. Most of the 45 respondents

answered  the  definition  of  landslide  by  the  book,  while  some  of  them  said  that  landslides  are

anything  that  slides  from  above  and  kills  people.  On  the  contrary,  most  of  the  37  people  who

answered  unrealistic  concepts  believed  that  all  landslides  are  slow  and  can  be  avoided.  These

descriptions are apparently based on their experiences. Some of the 37 people said that they have

already seen actual landslides in situ. However, their descriptions of the events mostly refer to the

concept  of  “shallow  landslides”.  Some  said  that  landslides  are not the problem and blamed the

thoughtlessness  of  the  people. Some even blamed those who have become landslide victims for

their tragic fates, and said that those people who die, or become affected by these disasters do not

know where to properly build a house. Additionally, most of the 37 people said that they have not

attended any seminars about landslides and landslide prevention.

The  respondents  were  also  asked  to  assess  their  capacity  to  respond  on  landslide

occurrences.  All  of them answered that they do not have any resources to prevent any landslide

occurrences,  or  even  the  awareness  of  the  existence  of  such. In the study, three resources were

given  as  the  examples  of  resources  to  lessen  the  probability  of  landslide  occurrences:  slope

drainage, slope wall protection, and gardens with deep root system. All the respondents answered

that  they  are  now  aware  of  any  of  the  techniques,  and  even  if  they  are, they would not go the

effort  of spending since it is the government’s duty to do so. However, some of the respondents

from Timberland Heights and Amiya Raya said that given the chance, they would not hesitate to

pay for these landslide prevention methods. On the other hand, all res

Lastly,  the  respondents  were  asked  of  their  response  orientation.  Out  of  the  82

respondents, 53 answered that they would only take the action during or after the landslide have

already occurred. The remaining 29, on the contrary, clearly stated that they would do everything

to  prevent  a  landslide  from  happening. Most of the 53 people who were considered reactive by

the  questionnaire  said  that  from  their  experience,  landslides  in  San  Mateo  are  not  deadly.

Compared  to the landslides that occur in Antipolo, Taytay, and Rodriguez, the landslides in San

Mateo are relatively less harmful, and deaths are extremely rare cases. They also said that instead

of  spending  most  of  their  time  on  focusing  on  something  that  can  never  be avoided (landslide

threats), they prefer to use it on many other “more important” things. Landslides are the least of

their concerns, and they will only react to it if the moment is upon them.

Lastly, the respondents were asked one direct question on their perception of their current

risk level. Of the 82 respondents asked, 50 answered that they are at high risk, and 32 answered

that they are at low risk. From these perceptions of the respondents, the second landslide risk map

was  produced  (see  figure  4.3.4).  The  ratio  of  the  risk  and  low  risk  values  are  shown  in figure

4.3.5.

v

Similar to the first landslide risk map produced, the map above shows the concentration

of the people who perceives themselves as highly at risk on landslide hazards. Their perceptions

are  based  on  many  factors,  most  of  which  are  already  explained  above.  In  the  map,  it  can  be

noticed that there are three respondents on the low land who considered themselves as highly at

risk despite their absence of exposure to landslides. One of the main reasons for this is that they

completely  have  no  knowledge  on  the  areal  hazard  extent of the landslides in the municipality.

Also,  those  three  respondents  all  answered  the  same  thing:  “think  that  landslides  from  the

highlands can reach their current locations”. Also, they have become aware of the latest landslide

that occurred in the municipality which caused one death. These reasons, and many more, created

an uneasy feeling in their thoughts, hence making them to perceive that they are currently at risk

to  landslide  hazards.  Meanwhile,  in  a  completely  different  case  from  them,  there  are  also

respondents located in areas of high density who treat themselves as safe from any risks at all. An

example  would  be that black point in the brown area of the map. Even though all his neighbors

considered  themselves  as  people  who  are  at  risk  to  landslides,  he  still  considered  himself  as

“relatively safe”. He said that he’s well aware of the hazardous areas in the municipality, and he

knows  a  lot  about  landslides.  He’s  also  currently  working  at  the  municipal  disaster  and  risk

reduction  management  office.  These  are  the  reasons  why  he  considered  his  answer.  Also,  the

people  who  are  located  near  the  high  susceptible  areas  (based  on  the  LHM)  considered

themselves as relatively at minimal risk. Most of their answers revolve around the fact that they

seldom stay in that areas. Most of the houses located in the said area are just rest houses for some.

Also, before they chose to live in the area, the planners of their community made it clear that the

area is safe.

All the qualitative answers provided above are the general reasons of their choice. To add

an additional explanation on these answers, logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate

the  significance  of  each  factors  (awareness,  recognition,  understanding,  capacity,  and  response

orientation) to their answer on their risk-perception. The results from the survey questions based

on the preparedness model showed that out of the five (5) factors used as independent variables,

only three were significant in influencing the dependent variable (see table 4.3.3)

Based  on  the  table  above,  the recognition of the landslide risks, level of understanding,

and response orientation all influence the risk-perception of the respondents. The three factors all

have  a  p-value  less  than  0.05  and  a  non-zero  Wald  statistic.  On  the  other  hand,  landslide

awareness  and  capacity  to  respond  were  disregarded  by  the  analysis  because  of  their

insignificance  to  the  model.  Also,  almost  62%  of  the  variability  of  the  dependent  variable  is

explained by the three factors considered (see table 4.3.4).

It is important to remember that this statistical test was just performed to at least provide

supplementary explanations on how the respondents perceived their current levels of risk.  At the

end  of  the  day,  their  real  experiences  and  stories  are  the  real  factors  of  their  choice,  and

qualitative answers can never be quantified.

ii.  Willingness Diagram

The result of the willingness diagram is shown in figure 4.3.6. There is no proper way to

use the original diagram because the plotting is purely manual. The researcher devised a new way

into which the plots will still make sense. Results of the diagram show that all people are willing

to  accept  the  risks  they  are  currently  taking.  This  is  done  through  attending  seminars  and

discussions about landslides and the correct ways on dealing with it. However, out of the 82 who

are  willing  to  actually  accept  the  risks,  only  27  chose  to  solely  accept  it  and  do  nothing  else.

Sixteen  out  of  these  82  people  are  willing  to  accept  the  risks  and  pay.  They  said that they are

always  willing  to  pay  for  infrastructures  that  might  prevent  landslides  from  occurring  such  as

slope drainages, gardens, and slope protections. On the other hand, the remaining 39 are willing

to  change  the  environment and accept the risk. This is different to the previous choice in a way

that  this  does  not require any form of payments. They will accept any free government projects

that  might  change  their  environment  without  consideration  of  its  negative  effects  on  their

livelihood, in exchange for their safety and protection. Meanwhile, no one is willing to leave their

current locations, and no one is willing to only pay for their safety. Also, no one is willing to do

all three.

One  of  the  reasons  why  no  one  is  willing  to  leave  their  houses  is  because  they  have been

living  in  the  municipality  since  birth,  and  not  once  did  they  ever  experience  to  be  caught in a

landslide incident. They still believe that the deaths that have occurred recently are only isolated

cases of such common event. Also, no one is willing to only pay because it would not bring them

any benefit. Safety government projects are supposed to be free, and not sold. This means that the

taxes  they  pay  should  be  sufficient  enough  to  fund  the  projects  and  paying  an  extra  for  these

supposedly  mandatory  projects  is  the  most  absurd  thing  that  could ever happen. Some of them

said,  that  if  they  are  going  to  pay,  the  safety  they  have  “bought”  should  have  a  100%

effectiveness. The few people who are willing to accept the risk alone (or the people who want to

learn about landslides and nothing more) said that if the government’s doing nothing, then it’s up

to themselves to assure their safety.

iii.

Risk Attitudes

The  answers  of  the  respondents  are  analyzed  and  were  classified  into  the  three  major

types of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk seeker, and risk neutral. Risk averse are those people who

really  want to kill the risks before they even manifest. They are willing to do all actions and go

extra  miles  to  prevent  one  event  from  happening.  The  people  that  fell  under  this  category  are

those  29  people  who  considered  themselves  as  proactive  in terms of their response orientation.

Also included in this category are those 16 people who are willing to pay for their safety. Most of

these  people  include  the wealthy people located in the uplands, and the business establishments

on the lower elevated lands near the foot of the mountains.

Risk  seekers,  on  the  other  hand,  are those people who want to always gamble for luck.

They  do  not  want  to  focus  on  one  thing,  such  as  investing  time  on  the  prevention  of  the

landslides, because landslides are inevitable, and they would only be wasting their time trying to

combat such. Instead, they accept the risks, and try to do anything else. They will only act when

the  moment  comes  for them, with the hope that it will not significantly affect them in any way.

More  than  half  of  the  respondents  (53  out  of 82) were included in this category. Also included

here are those 27 people who are willing to accept the risks and attend seminars and increase their

knowledge to prevent such misfortunes.

The  last  category,  the  risk  neutrals,  are  those  people  between  the  spectrum  of  the  two

previous extremes. These people are not willing to pay extra money for their safety and also not

willing to accept the risks. They do not want reassurance, nor they want to gamble for luck. Those

who fall under this category are those people who are willing to accept any forms of changes in

their  environment.  In  the  study,  no  one  were  considered  as  risk  neutrals,  since  all  of  them are

actually willing to accept the risks. However, those 39 can be classified as slightly risk neutrals,

since they do not want to do any extra efforts to assure their safety, nor they want to completely

gamble and absolutely accept the risks.

C. Two Landslide Risk Maps

In  this part, the difference between the two landslide risk maps made are evaluated (see

figure 4.3.7). Their advantages and disadvantages are identified by the researcher and are further

analyzed and evaluated. Also, this part will consist mostly of the personal views and opinions of

the researcher.

Displayed above are the two landslide risk maps methodically produced by the researcher

through  the  integration  and  combination  of  different  frameworks  and  models.  The  figures

displayed  by  the  two  completely  different  approaches  are  near  to  each  other.  The  number  of

respondents  who  were  identified  as  at  risk  by  the  researcher  comprises  the  54%  of  their

population, and the respondents who considered themselves as at risk comprises 61% of the total

population.  The  same  is true with the respondents who are not at risk, and the respondents who

considered themselves as relatively at low risk than the others.

As  the  researcher,  I  think  that  the  main  difference  between  the two approaches is their

grounds  on  the  accuracy.  Obviously,  all  will  agree  that  the  first  map,  which  was  based  on  the

physical,  statistical,  technical,  and  the more objective approach has a relatively higher accuracy

than the second map. For instance, no respondents living in the lowlands were considered at risk

because  there  are  no  existing landslide hazards on the area. However, on the second map, there

are  three  respondents  at  the  low  lands who considered themselves at risk. The reasons for such

difference  are  their  grounds. The basis of the creation of the first map relies entirely on various

frameworks  and  theories  already  used  by  many  researchers.  Since  the  start  of  the  scientific

revolution,  the  accuracy  of  everything revolved around the numbers, and the objectives became

the  standards  for  everyone.  The  advantage  of  this  approach  is  that  its  current  accuracy  could

remain true in the future, regardless of who lives and who leaves. However, its accuracy does not

take  into  account  the  experiences  and  insights  of  the  people  who  are  experiencing  the hazards

first-hand.  The  second  map, which was based more on the perceptions, and the more subjective

approach, always considers this fact. At the end of the day, it is important to remember that it is

still the people who are experiencing these kinds of dangers, and they are the only one who can

assess their limits and strengths in facing such problems. However, we should also not forget the

individuality  of  the  people.  Every  people  are  unique  in their own ways, and they all have their

own  share  of  views  on  different  things. Also, not all the people are exposed to certain kinds of

privilege  such  as  the  knowledge  on  hazards,  money  to  pay  for  projects,  and  connections  with

other  people.  The  society  has  always  laid  an  unfair  system  of  distribution  to  the people which

made  some  live  in  extreme  fortune  and  some  in  severe destitution. This is the weakness of the

second  map,  as  it  only  runs  under  the  assumption  that  everyone  knows  the  landslide  hazard

extent, and the standards to measure vulnerability.

Finally,  I  think  that  both maps are equally important in conducting assessments such as

landslide  risks.  Although  both  have  their own strengths and weaknesses, they still do their own

part and provide knowledge to everyone. However, even though both maps have their own equal

importance, is still better if they are both used in studies like these.  Each of these maps can exist

independently, but it is always better to exist when combined.

CHAPTER V

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Most  of  the  areas  that  are  not  susceptible  to  landslides  are  in  the  west,  and  in

some  lowly  elevated  lands  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  municipality.  All  flat  lands  were

considered  as  not  susceptible  to  any  landslide  hazards  at  all because the map produced

only shows the susceptibility of the areas to slope failures, not the extent of the landslide

pours.   The other three susceptibility classes are distributed in the central and the eastern

part  of  San  Mateo.  The  highly  susceptible  areas  to  landslides  are located on the higher

altitudinal  lands,  most  of  which  are  situated  in  the  central  to  the  eastern  part  of  the

municipality.

There  are  extremely  few  areas  of  high  susceptibility  in  most of the areas where

the  respondents  are  located.  This  information  is  crucial  because  most of the vulnerable

respondents  were  found  in  the  highlands  south  of  the  municipality.  Fortunately,  only

moderate and low susceptible areas exist in the area where these vulnerable respondents

currently  reside.  This  fact,  however,  is  still  not  good  news  since  most  of  the  latest

landslide events that occurred in the municipality are located in the same area where the

vulnerable  are  concentrated.  Again,  moderate  and

low  susceptibility  are  still

susceptibilities, and should not be taken less seriously.

The  location  of  landslide hazards and the location of the most vulnerable people

are  essential  because  it  projects  the  possible  locations  of  the  people  who  are  highly  at

risk.  Most  of  the  respondents  who are highly at risk are the same individuals who were

identified as the vulnerable respondents. However, the vulnerable people in the flat lands

were  considered  as  not  at  risk  since  there  are  no  landslide  hazards  that  threatens  their

safety.

More  than  half  of  the  population  of  the  participants  perceived  themselves  as

highly  at risk while the remaining population considered themselves as relatively at low

risk.  Their  reasons  for  these  perceptions  are  based  on  many  reasons,  such  as  their

experiences, knowledges, resources at hand, and willingness to act. However, the results

of  the  regression  showed  that  the  only  their  recognition  of  the  risks,  level  of

understanding, and response orientation have an effect on their perceptions of themselves

as  people  who  are  at  risks.  Additionally,  all  people  are  willing  to  accept  the  risks  and

lessen  its  impacts  through  various  means  such  as  attending  the  seminars  on landslides,

increasing the self-knowledge about mitigations, etc. Some are willing to accept the risk

and  change  the  environment  free  of  charge  for  their safety. Some, however, are willing

the  accept  the  risks  and  pay  for  their  safety.  The  respondents  were  classified  into  two

groups based on their risk attitudes: risk averse and risk seekers.

Consequently, the results of the two landslide risk maps produced somewhat show

similar  patterns.  Most  of  the  people  who  considered  themselves  as  highly at risk, were

actually  at  risk,  while  most  of  those  who  considered themselves as otherwise, were not

really  at  risk  at  all.  However,  there  were  also  cases  where  the  people  who  considered

themselves  at  risk,  are  not  really  at  risk  at  all,  while  some  of  those  who  are  at  risk

considered themselves as not at risk. The explanations to these cases are solely based on

the individual’s opinion and experiences.

The  two  landslide  risk  maps  generated  both  share  their  own dose of adequacies

and  shortcomings.  While  the  first  landslide  risk  map  can  be  considered  as  the  more

accurate  approach,  it  does  not  take  into  account  the  experiences  of  the  people  who

actually lives in the study area. Some of the opinions of the people used in producing the

second  landslide  risk  map,  however,  are  influenced  by  many  social  inequalities  and

privileges. The approach of two methods also differ in a way that the risks manifested on

the  first  map  is  defined  by  the  researcher  using  several  statistical  tools,  accepted

frameworks, and strong theories. On the other hand, the risks shown on the second map is

created by the people exposed on the hazards themselves, using their perceptions, current

knowledge, and different experiences. As a study that embodies the ideals of Geography

which studies everything related to the realm encompassing the physical and the human,

the  thesis  of  this  comparative  study  concludes  that  in  conducting  landslide  risk

assessments, it is always better to approach the issue from the different sides of the same

coin to have a larger grasp of what is really happening in the problem.

Since  the  landslide  hazard  assessment  used  in  the study is a predictive mapping

approach, it is suggested that the future researchers who might want to conduct the same

method  used  in  the  research  gather  more  credible,  and  more  established  data  from  the

government.  Also,  it  is  highly  suggested  that the approach to take on acquiring the risk

perceptions  of  the  people  in  the  municipality  be  purely  qualitative  to  avoid  the

summarization of the answers. Lastly, as a study conducted in a hazard-prone country, the

researcher  encourages  the  future  advocates  who  are  very  interested  in  disaster  and risk

reduction management studies to conduct more DRRM – related studies in different areas

of the Philippines.
